Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: Who received the IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award in 2010?\nGold target: Michio Sugeno\nPredicted answer: The IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award in 2010 was received by Terrence J. Sejnowski.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "143fd66ed26e8e02619366d010ba41c9": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: Who was awarded the Oceanography Society's Jerlov Award in 2018?\nGold target: Annick Bricaud\nPredicted answer: The Oceanography Society's Jerlov Award in 2018 was awarded to Dr. Curtis D. Mobley for his significant contributions to the field of ocean optics.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "e6452553b9d3bb0bc20b113bbfce7d12": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: What's the name of the women's liberal arts college in Cambridge, Massachusetts?\nGold target: Radcliffe College\nPredicted answer: The women's liberal arts college in Cambridge, Massachusetts is **Radcliffe College**. Historically, it was the women's coordinate college for Harvard University. However, Radcliffe College officially merged with Harvard in 1999 and now functions as the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. If you are referring to a current standalone women's liberal arts college in Cambridge, there isn't one; Radcliffe was the primary institution of that kind.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "17c0f53cc173233bc5a3d4bd4ada455b": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: In whose honor was the Leipzig 1877 tournament organized?\nGold target: Adolf Anderssen\nPredicted answer: The Leipzig 1877 chess tournament was organized in honor of the 25th anniversary of the local chess club, the Leipziger Schachgesellschaft (Leipzig Chess Society).\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: According to Karl Küchler, what did Empress Elizabeth of Austria's favorite sculpture depict, which was made for her villa Achilleion at Corfu?\nGold target: Poet Henrich Heine.\nPredicted answer: According to Karl Küchler, Empress Elizabeth of Austria's favorite sculpture, made for her villa Achilleion at Corfu, depicted the Greek hero Achilles. The sculpture portrayed Achilles in a contemplative, sorrowful pose, reflecting themes of heroism and tragic destiny that resonated deeply with the Empress.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "15daa363fccff1757ed82e46e5fb747f": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: How much money, in euros, was the surgeon held responsible for Stella Obasanjo's death ordered to pay her son?\nGold target: 120,000\nPredicted answer: The surgeon held responsible for Stella Obasanjo's death was ordered to pay her son 1.5 million euros.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "da41b6ba64e8579eadfe3dc98174030b": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: What were the month and year when Obama told Christianity Today, \"I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus Christ\"?\nGold target: January 2008\nPredicted answer: Barack Obama made the statement, \"I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus Christ,\" in an interview with Christianity Today in **October 2006**.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "b40bbd80464afead411902e18638ddef": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: Who appointed the Chief Justice of India, Mirza Hameedullah Beg, in 1977?\nGold target: Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed\nPredicted answer: Mirza Hameedullah Beg was appointed as the Chief Justice of India in 1977 by then-President Neelam Sanjiva Reddy.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: What is the name of the former Prime Minister of Iceland who worked as a cabin crew member until 1971?\nGold target: Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir\nPredicted answer: The former Prime Minister of Iceland who worked as a cabin crew member until 1971 is Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "033ce579c97058d675297258bfecde6f": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: To whom did Mehbooba Mufti Sayed contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and lose?\nGold target: Hasnain Masoodi\nPredicted answer: Mehbooba Mufti Sayed contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from the Anantnag constituency in Jammu and Kashmir. She lost to Hasnain Masoodi of the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference (JKNC).\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: How many fouls did Inter commit in the Champions League final match between Bayern and Inter on May 23, 2010?\nGold target: 13\nPredicted answer: In the UEFA Champions League final on May 22, 2010 (the match took place on May 22, not May 23), between Bayern Munich and Inter Milan, Inter Milan committed 24 fouls.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "0a01ae00eb83a01791f1c5936e6c47d3": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: What year did the Lego part with ID gal56 first release?\nGold target: 2002\nPredicted answer: The LEGO part with the ID \"gal56\" corresponds to the **Minifigure, Headgear Helmet Space Classic with Visor** (often referred to as the classic space helmet with a transparent visor).\n\nThis part was first released in **1979** as part of the original LEGO Classic Space theme.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: In which year did the Japanese scientist Koichi Mizushima receive the Kato Memorial Prize?\nGold target: 1999\nPredicted answer: Koichi Mizushima received the Kato Memorial Prize in the year 2000.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "e6f194f228f002058ba0103e99911102": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: In which year did Melbourne's Monash Gallery of Art (MGA) rebrand and become the Museum of Australian Photography (MAPh)?\nGold target: 2023\nPredicted answer: Melbourne's Monash Gallery of Art (MGA) rebranded and became the Museum of Australian Photography (MAPh) in the year **2023**.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "97345029b724eb0595a53c48c9827476": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: Who requested the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) implement a 900 sq mi (2,300 km2) temporary flight restriction zone over the operations areas of the Deepwater Horizon?\nGold target: The Coast Guard\nPredicted answer: The temporary flight restriction (TFR) zone of approximately 900 square miles (2,300 km²) over the Deepwater Horizon operations area was requested by the U.S. Coast Guard. The Coast Guard, as the lead federal agency managing the response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, requested the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to implement this TFR to ensure safety and security during the emergency response operations.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "c2cc3fd39521f691840424ec3e1ad540": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: What signature piece of the MOBA did Scott Wilson discover on the curb between two trash cans?\nGold target: Lucy in the Field with Flowers\nPredicted answer: Scott Wilson discovered the original *Dota 2* logo, which has become a signature piece of the MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) genre, on the curb between two trash cans. This iconic logo was found as a physical stencil or artwork discarded but later recognized for its significance to the game community.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: What player scored all the conversions for Spain in the rugby match between Spain and Romania that was part of the 2022 Rugby Europe Championship on February 27, 2022?\nGold target: Manuel Ordas\nPredicted answer: The player who scored all the conversions for Spain in the rugby match against Romania on February 27, 2022, during the 2022 Rugby Europe Championship was **Marc Castell**.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "dafd6b4e7176571e2b81ab752758171d": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: What is the surname of the psychiatrist who prescribes medication for Marie Hanson for her periodic blackouts in Season 1, Episode 20 of Ally McBeal?\nGold target: Peters\nPredicted answer: The surname of the psychiatrist who prescribes medication for Marie Hanson in Season 1, Episode 20 of *Ally McBeal* is **Klaus**.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "b356acdea8536872943db26985ed9782": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: What is the British-American kickboxer Andrew Tate's kickboxing name?\nGold target: King cobra\nPredicted answer: Andrew Tate's kickboxing nickname is \"Cobra.\"\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "df6ca831cc04fc0ed943ccd56c80fbe4": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: What position was John Gilbert Layton appointed to in Quebec from 1969 until 1970?\nGold target:  Quebec Youth Parliament prime minister\nPredicted answer: John Gilbert Layton was appointed as the Commissioner of the Quebec Liquor Commission from 1969 until 1970.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: Who won the Gerard P. Kuiper Prize in 2001?\nGold target: Bruce W. Hapke\nPredicted answer: The Gerard P. Kuiper Prize in 2001 was awarded to William F. Bottke.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "8d9e290ccac7210b526c7f015f80aaa4": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: Which streamer won the \"Best VTuber Streamer\" award at The Streamer Awards in 2022?\nGold target: CodeMiko\nPredicted answer: The \"Best VTuber Streamer\" award at The Streamer Awards in 2022 was won by Ironmouse.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "0e8a3ea1313a7c008eb365436432c2c3": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: What did Daemon Targaryen say to Rhaenyra about living life in fear in Episode 4, Season 1 of House of the Dragon?\nGold target: You cannot live your life in fear, or you will forsake the best parts of it.\nPredicted answer: In Episode 4 of Season 1 of *House of the Dragon*, Daemon Targaryen tells Rhaenyra something along the lines of: **\"Life is not a song. You don't get to live it without ever knowing fear.\"** This line reflects his perspective that fear is an inevitable part of life and ruling, and that one must face it rather than try to avoid it. It underscores the show's themes about power, courage, and the harsh realities of their world.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "fb0244bd88d2057e16acbc9280f2f87c": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: On which U.S. TV station did the Canadian reality series *To Serve and Protect* debut?\nGold target: KVOS-TV\nPredicted answer: The Canadian reality series *To Serve and Protect* debuted on the U.S. TV station Court TV.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: What instrument did Alec Aitken play well enough for a professional musician to remark, \"Aitken is the most accomplished amateur musician I have ever known\"?\nGold target: Violin\nPredicted answer: Alec Aitken was an accomplished pianist. A professional musician once remarked, \"Aitken is the most accomplished amateur musician I have ever known,\" referring to his skill on the piano.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: On what day, month, and year did Tara Chand (a politician and a Dalit leader from Jammu and Kashmir) resign from the Indian National Congress in support of Ghulam Nabi Azad?\nGold target: August 30, 2022\nPredicted answer: Tara Chand resigned from the Indian National Congress on **August 30, 2022**, in support of Ghulam Nabi Azad.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "11f1628fcf0df53ea0cfdee3accc971b": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: What was the strike rate of Harbhajan Singh in the final match of IPL 2015?\nGold target: 200.00\nPredicted answer: In the final match of IPL 2015, Harbhajan Singh played for Mumbai Indians against Chennai Super Kings. Harbhajan Singh bowled 4 overs, gave 22 runs, and took 2 wickets.\n\nTo calculate his strike rate (number of balls bowled per wicket taken):\n\n- Balls bowled = 4 overs × 6 balls = 24 balls\n- Wickets taken = 2\n\nStrike rate = Balls bowled / Wickets taken = 24 / 2 = 12\n\n**Harbhajan Singh's bowling strike rate in the IPL 2015 final was 12.**\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "ed04d136941abda1aeca002f4f5a8874": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: In the lore of Dungeons and Dragons, what is the name of the fortress in the Astral Plane used as a lair by the red great wyrm Ashardalon?\nGold target: Bastion of Unborn Souls\nPredicted answer: In Dungeons & Dragons lore, the red great wyrm Ashardalon uses the fortress called **Ashardalon's Lair**, also known as **Ashardalon's Citadel**, as his lair in the Astral Plane. This fortress serves as a stronghold and is a notable location in various D&D adventures and sourcebooks featuring Ashardalon.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "32fc95e3bb02f36211d2864a0a0f7234": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: In which episode and season of South Park does Bill Cosby (BSM-471) first appear? Give me the number and title.\nGold target: Season 4 Episode 12: \"Trapper Keeper\"\nPredicted answer: Bill Cosby (BSM-471) first appears in **Season 19, Episode 1**, titled **\"Stunning and Brave\"** of South Park.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: The WWI Q-Ship \"Salvia\" was partially reconstructed with a false counter-stern to resemble what kind of ship?\nGold target: tramp\nPredicted answer: The World War I Q-ship **Salvia** was partially reconstructed with a false counter-stern to resemble a **merchant vessel**. This disguise was intended to deceive enemy submarines into thinking she was an unarmed, vulnerable merchant ship, thereby luring them into close range before Salvia revealed her hidden armaments and engaged.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "da5cbb2af76307cd4d3ef2b023330000": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: Which district in Kashmir was originally known as Panwangam?\nGold target: Pulwama\nPredicted answer: The district in Kashmir that was originally known as Panwangam is **Pulwama**.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "d860cc0cc691586a989b0b60b151df7d": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: In 1810, François Aimé Louis Dumoulin published a collection of how many engravings themed on the journey of \"Robinson Crusoe\"?\nGold target: 150\nPredicted answer: In 1810, François Aimé Louis Dumoulin published a collection of **12 engravings** themed on the journey of \"Robinson Crusoe.\"\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "313430b2e700821ec753170983e6ed2f": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: What day, month, and year was Carrie Underwood's album \"Cry Pretty\" certified Gold by the RIAA?\nGold target: October 23, 2018\nPredicted answer: Carrie Underwood's album **\"Cry Pretty\"** was certified Gold by the RIAA on **September 17, 2019**.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: In the series \"El guardián invisible,\" who portrays the character Alfonso Álvarez de Toledo?\nGold target: Ramón Barea\nPredicted answer: In the series \"El guardián invisible,\" the character Alfonso Álvarez de Toledo is portrayed by actor Elvira Mínguez.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "61424bece9cb378585fbe2a21406da17": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: On what day, month, and year was David Sweet, Canadian politician, born?\nGold target: June 24, 1957\nPredicted answer: David Sweet, the Canadian politician, was born on September 24, 1957.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: From which high school did the first female governor of Hawaii, United States, graduate?\nGold target: Birmingham High School\nPredicted answer: The first female governor of Hawaii, Linda Lingle, graduated from Punahou School in Honolulu, Hawaii.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: In which month and year did Khusro Bakhtiar (former Federal Minister for Planning, Development, and Reforms, Pakistan) announce that the government was considering establishing a Pak-China business council to promote the private sector's role in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)?\nGold target: June 2019\nPredicted answer: Khusro Bakhtiar announced that the government was considering establishing a Pak-China business council to promote the private sector's role in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) in **January 2020**.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "8a83c7c5c610bd06feeccfb8b4fb9d02": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: What is the first and last name of the woman whom the British linguist Bernard Comrie married in 1985?\nGold target: Akiko Kumahira\nPredicted answer: The British linguist Bernard Comrie married Maria Polinsky in 1985.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: What are the first names and surnames of the figure skaters who came 21st in the ice dance category at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing?\nGold target: Katharina Müller and Tim Dieck\nPredicted answer: The ice dance team that placed 21st at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing was Diana Davis and Gleb Smolkin.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "77f54ae727420c4106347f609c2a44ea": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: What is the name of the kibbutz that Simon Le Bon lived on in 1978?\nGold target: Gvulot.\nPredicted answer: Simon Le Bon lived on Kibbutz Ma'agan Michael in 1978.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: Who won the 1991 Ig Nobel Prize for Peace?\nGold target: Edward Teller\nPredicted answer: The 1991 Ig Nobel Prize for Peace was awarded to the team of scientists who developed the \"Acoustic Kitty\" project, a CIA experiment attempting to use cats for espionage by implanting listening devices in them. The prize humorously recognized the unusual and somewhat absurd nature of the project.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "46bad3833d0ff1db6f0040a97632c3df": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: Why did David Chow come to Genoa City on \"The Young and the Restless\"?\nGold target: To avenge the murder of his former fiancée, Carmen Mesta.\nPredicted answer: David Chow came to Genoa City on \"The Young and the Restless\" primarily to help run his family's business, Chancellor Industries, and to get involved in the corporate and personal dramas surrounding the Newman and Abbott families. His arrival stirred up various storylines involving business rivalries, romantic entanglements, and family conflicts.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "ed9d48c356f88b2b41ce2afec767631d": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: In which season and episode of Archer does Sterling go into a rampage? Give me the season, number, and title of the episode.\nGold target: Season 2, Episode 9 \"Placebo Effect\"\nPredicted answer: Sterling Archer goes on a rampage in **Season 4, Episode 6**, titled **\"Once Bitten\"**.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "605f6cd4577b16cd996df3fcb7c5920d": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: On what day, month, and year was Algerian artist Mohammed Racim born?\nGold target: June 24th, 1896.\nPredicted answer: Algerian artist Mohammed Racim was born on September 20, 1896.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: How many original artworks were shown in the Society of Illustrators' first \"Annual Exhibition\"?\nGold target: 350\nPredicted answer: The Society of Illustrators' first \"Annual Exhibition,\" held in 1903, showcased **123 original artworks**.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: In what year was Eugenius Aristides Nisbet elected to the Georgia House of Representatives?\nGold target: 1827\nPredicted answer: Eugenius Aristides Nisbet was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1830.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: What day/month/year was it announced that the politician Ibrahim Rugova had been diagnosed with lung cancer?\nGold target: 5 September 2005\nPredicted answer: It was announced that the politician Ibrahim Rugova had been diagnosed with lung cancer on August 24, 2006.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: In 2022, which university did Honda Battle of the Bands (HBOB) select to be the first-ever HBCU campus to host the in-person event?\nGold target: Alabama State University\nPredicted answer: In 2022, the Honda Battle of the Bands (HBOB) selected Alabama A&M University to be the first-ever HBCU campus to host the in-person event.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: Who wrote the lyrics to \"Dream Serenade,\" the opening theme song for the radio program \"The American Album of Familiar Music\"?\nGold target: Alfred Bryan\nPredicted answer: The lyrics to \"Dream Serenade,\" the opening theme song for the radio program *The American Album of Familiar Music*, were written by James Melton.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "018f14d5dfde6c4f6ec75b64f7cc1202": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: In what year did Etta Cone last visit Europe?\nGold target: 1938\nPredicted answer: Etta Cone last visited Europe in 1939.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."
