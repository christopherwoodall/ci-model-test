The hospital had just opened a new research wing, and the writers needed a fresh, young doctor who could bring a modern, \u201ctech\u2011savvy\u201d perspective to the medical team. The producers introduced David as the **new head of the hospital\u2019s experimental oncology/clinical\u2011trials unit**, hired by Dr. **Anita** (the hospital\u2019s chief medical officer) to help develop a cutting\u2011edge treatment that would later become a plot point for several other characters.  \n\n*At the same time, the writers used David\u2019s arrival to launch a **personal\u2011revenge/\u201cfamily\u2011secret\u201d** storyline. David\u2019s **younger sister, Lily Chow**, had been murdered in a hit\u2011and\u2011run accident in Genoa City a year earlier. The police never solved the case, and David\u2019s \u201cofficial\u201d job at the hospital gave him a legitimate reason to be in town while he **quietly investigates** who was responsible for his sister\u2019s death. This gave him a natural connection to the existing characters\u2014especially **Victor Newman**, who was indirectly tied to the accident through a business deal, and **Nikki** (the detective who originally worked the case).  \n\n**How it fit into the show\u2019s larger narrative**  \n\n1. **Professional connection:**  \n   - By placing David in the hospital, the writers could bring him into scenes with **Dr. Kevin Fisher**, **Dr. Jack Abbott**, and **Dr. Neil Winters**, creating medical\u2011drama storylines (patient crises, experimental trials, hospital politics).  \n   - His tech\u2011savvy background allowed the writers to introduce a **new \u201cdigital\u2011health\u201d subplot** (e.g., a tele\u2011medicine platform that becomes a plot point in the rivalry between **Jabot** and **Newman Enterprises**).  \n\n2. **Personal/ investigative arc:**  \n   - The \u201csister\u2019s death\u201d angle gave David a built\u2011in motive to be suspicious of **Victor** and **Nikki**, and to cross paths with **Phyllis** and **Jack** who were involved in the original accident.  \n   - The investigation tied into the ongoing **\u201cMurder\u2011Mystery\u201d** storyline that had been unfolding for several months, giving the writers a fresh suspect list and a new \u201cdetective\u201d (David) who could go undercover as a doctor while following clues.  \n\n3. **Romantic/ relational potential:**  \n   - While investigating, David meets **Megan**, a nurse and longtime friend of **Nikki**, creating a **new love\u2011interest** subplot that adds emotional depth and gives the show a fresh romantic pairing.  \n   - The romance also serves as a bridge between the **hospital world** and the **Newman/Abbott family drama**\u2014Megan\u2019s brother works for **Jabot**, so David\u2019s relationship with her introduces a subtle corporate\u2011political tension.  \n\n**Bottom line:**  \n\nDavid Chow\u2019s arrival in Genoa City was **purpose\u2011driven**: he was recruited as a new doctor at Genoa City Hospital (giving the show fresh medical storylines) and, simultaneously, he was in town to **track down the person responsible for his sister\u2019s death**. The dual purpose allowed the writers to weave him into the existing tapestry of families, business rivalries, and romantic entanglements that drive *The Young and the Restless*.", "metadata": {"grade": "incorrect", "grade_letter": "B", "grading_response": "B"}, "sample_id": 42}, {"value": 0.0, "answer": "**Season 3 \u2013 Episode\u202f13 \u2013 \u201cThe Man Who Would Be King\u201d**  \n\nIn this episode, Sterling Archer (the titular \u201cArcher\u201d) goes on a full\u2011blown rampage, which is the source of the famous \u201cRAMPAGE!\u201d meme.
