By courting her (and, by extension, the Abbott family), he hoped to gain access to the Abbott wealth and the lucrative corporate assets tied to **Jabot Cosmetics**. |\n| **Use a fake charity/venture as a front** | He introduced a bogus charitable foundation (the \u201cDavid Chow Foundation\u201d) that he claimed would benefit Genoa City. This gave him a respectable cover for meetings with town officials, charity events, and, most importantly, a reason to ask for large donations or investments. |\n| **Exploit the town\u2019s secrets** | While courting Ashley, David also tried to dig up dirt on other residents (e.g., Victor Newman, Nikki, and the Newmans) that he could leverage for blackmail or to negotiate better deals. |\n| **Create drama and a new \u201cvillain\u201d** | From a storytelling perspective, the writers needed a fresh antagonist who could stir up the Abbott and Newman families, fuel romance intrigue, and generate a series of \u201ccon\u2011artist\u2011exposed\u201d moments typical of daytime drama. David Chow filled that role. |\n\n**In\u2011show storyline summary**\n\n- **First appearance:** David shows up at a charity gala, introducing himself as a philanthropist looking to invest in Genoa City projects.\n- **Romantic bait:** He quickly befriends **Ashley Abbott**, offering to help expand her cosmetics line and hinting at a possible partnership.\n- **The con:** Behind the scenes, David\u2019s real plan is to siphon money from Ashley\u2019s accounts and use the Abbott name to legitimize his fraudulent business deals.\n- **Unraveling:** As the Abbott family (especially Victor and Ashley) start to suspect something, other characters (e.g., **Jack Abbott** and **Victor Newman**) investigate, leading to David\u2019s eventual exposure and departure (or arrest) from Genoa City.\n\nSo, in short, David Chow came to Genoa City **to con the wealthy Abbott family\u2014particularly Ashley Abbott\u2014by masquerading as a respectable businessman and philanthropist, using romance and a fake charity as his entry point.** His arrival was designed to create a fresh conflict and a classic \u201ccon\u2011artist\u2011gets\u2011caught\u201d storyline for *The Young and the Restless*.", "metadata": {"grade": "incorrect", "grade_letter": "B", "grading_response": "B"}, "sample_id": 42}, {"value": 0.0, "answer": "**Season\u202f2 \u2013 Episode\u202f6 \u2013 \u201cThe Man Who Knew Too Much.\u201d**  \n\nIn this episode Sterling Archer is forced to confront his drinking problem, which triggers a full\u2011blown office\u2011wide rampage.", "metadata": {"grade": "incorrect", "grade_letter": "B", "grading_response": "B"}, "sample_id": 43}, {"value": 0.0, "answer": "Mohammed\u202fRacim was born on **23\u202fJune\u202f1880**.", "metadata": {"grade": "incorrect", "grade_letter": "B", "grading_response": "B"}, "sample_id": 44}, {"value": 0.0, "answer": "The Society of Illustrators\u2019 very first \u201cAnnual Exhibition,\u201d held in 1902, featured **200 original artworks**.", "metadata": {"grade": "incorrect", "grade_letter": "B", "grading_response": "B"}, "sample_id": 45}, {"value": 0.0, "answer": "Eugenius\u202fAristides\u202fNisbet was first elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in **1829** (he served in the 1829\u20131830 legislative session).", "metadata": {"grade": "incorrect", "grade_letter": "B", "grading_response": "B"}, "sample_id": 46}, {"value": 0.0, "answer": "Ibrahim\u202fRugova\u2019s diagnosis of lung cancer was made public on **30\u202fSeptember\u202f2005**.", "metadata": {"grade": "incorrect", "grade_letter": "B", "grading_response": "B"}, "sample_id": 47}, {"value": 0.0, "answer": "In\u202f2022, Honda\u202fBattle\u202fof\u202fthe\u202fBands chose **Jackson\u202fState\u202fUniversity** as the first\u2011ever HBCU campus to host its in\u2011person event.", "metadata": {"grade": "incorrect", "grade_letter": "B", "grading_response": "B"}, "sample_id": 48}, {"value": 0.0, "answer": "The lyricist for \u201cDream\u202fSerenade,\u201d the opening theme of **The\u202fAmerican\u202fAlbum\u202fof\u202fFamiliar\u202fMusic**, was **Mack\u202fGordon**.", "metadata": {"grade": "incorrect", "grade_letter": "B", "grading_response": "B"}, "sample_id": 49}, {"value": 0.0, "answer": "Etta\u202fCone\u2019s final trip to Europe took place in **1936**.
