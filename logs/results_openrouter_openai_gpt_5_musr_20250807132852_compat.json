She was a nurse at the hospital where Daniel was a patient, giving her unrestricted access to his room among others.

Daniel\\'s body had been found at the zoo, his bright red hat found lodged in a tree by the monkey enclosure caught his eye. Early afternoon, he thought to himself. That was when Daniel arrived.\\\\n\\\\nDaniel had been at Amelia\\'s bar the night before he was found dead. Within a corner, separated by the clinking of glasses and the cacophony of laughter, Amelia had noticed Daniel with a friend, showcasing some old pictures on his phone, laughing and boasting about their origin. Amongst these, were humiliating photos he had discovered of Amelia from college. The surprise jolt she felt when she saw her own face from the past peering back at her.\\\\n\\\\nThe bartender was a liked figure, as far as Winston had heard from various patrons. She was known for her flawless reputation, partnered with her proficiency in handling syringes - a necessary detail given her innovative drink creations.\\\\n\\\\nHis mind wandered back to what he had learnt from the police report. Apparently, Daniel had been killed by a lethal injection, distributed so expertly that there was only one syringe mark on his body. A murder weapon that, undoubtedly, connected to Amelia. \\\\n\\\\nThen he remembered Daniel\\'s friend mentioning a conversation at the bar... a piecing together of the puzzle. They had been laughing, Daniel proudly showing off old, humiliating college photos he had found of Amelia. Her past wasn\\'t a secret per se... it was just unnecessary information for a bartender to share.\\\\n\\\\nHe found himself walking towards the custom bar Amelia had set up early that morning at the zoo. Wanting to question her about Daniel\\'s boasting the night before, it served as her temporary workstation for special events.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\"Good afternoon, detective,\\\\\" Amelia greeted him with a casual familiarity.

Emma, a nurse,\u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mintroduced herself as the sister of the victim, Daniel. To those present-- mainly strangers, she was a \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mnew face. Interestingly enough, she made sure to gracefully ask everyone their names. Among the crowd \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mwere Daniel's family, whom she met for the first time that day, despite his prolonged treatment at the \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mhospital. This was an unusual circumstance Winston noted down.\\n\\nHuman tears could be telling. \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mWinston, having seen more than his fair share of grieving families and friends, noticed that Emma's \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mdisplay during Daniel's funeral was peculiar. Hers were the only eyes that were excessively wet, her \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mcrying far more pronounced than anyone else present. It intrigued him that despite this overwhelming \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mshow of emotion, nobody from the grieving family seemed to recognize her.\\n\\n\\\"Emma was in charge of \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mDaniel's care,\\\" Hannah, an admin worker at the hospital, provided when Winston sought better \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32munderstanding of Emma's relationship to the victim. As she spoke, Winston noted down in his \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mleather-bound notebook that Emma was responsible for Daniel's daily schedule due to her \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mduties.\\n\\nHannah then identified Emma from a picture Winston slid across the table. \\\"That's her. \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mShe's the one who organized that zoo trip for Daniel. His upbeat demeanor that day... He was having \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32msuch a good time away from the hospital.\\\" Hannah pausing to reflect brought further solemnity to the \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mmemory of that day when Daniel's body, and a syringe from their hospital, was found at the zoo.\\n\\nAs \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mWinston visited Emma's residence, her life as a nurse was exhibited by the random nursing memorabilia \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mdiscarded around the apartment; badges, maps of the hospital wards, even Daniel's daily schedule \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mcalendar. \\n\\nEmma's career in medicine wasn't surprising, given her fascination with the field. She \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mwas a nurse at the hospital where Daniel was a patient, giving her unrestricted access to his room \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mamong others. While her chosen path was understandable, it did make this case more convoluted than the \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32musual ones Winston had come across. As things were unfolding, Emma seemed like she could be a guardian \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mangel... or perhaps a devil in disguise. Winston would have to tread on this puzzle with utmost \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mcare.\\n\\nWinston pored over the crime scene photos spread haphazardly across his desk. Daniel's body \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mhad been found at the zoo, his bright red hat found lodged in a tree by the monkey enclosure caught his\u001b[0m\n\u001b[32meye. Early afternoon, he thought to himself. That was when Daniel arrived.\\n\\nDaniel had been at \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mAmelia's bar the night before he was found dead. Within a corner, separated by the clinking of glasses \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mand the cacophony of laughter, Amelia had noticed Daniel with a friend, showcasing some old pictures on\u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mhis phone, laughing and boasting about their origin. Amongst these, were humiliating photos he had \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mdiscovered of Amelia from college. The surprise jolt she felt when she saw her own face from the past \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mpeering back at her.\\n\\nThe bartender was a liked figure, as far as Winston had heard from various \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mpatrons. She was known for her flawless reputation, partnered with her proficiency in handling syringes\u001b[0m\n\u001b[32m- a necessary detail given her innovative drink creations.\\n\\nHis mind wandered back to what he had \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mlearnt from the police report. Apparently, Daniel had been killed by a lethal injection, distributed so\u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mexpertly that there was only one syringe mark on his body. A murder weapon that, undoubtedly, connected\u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mto Amelia. \\n\\nThen he remembered Daniel's friend mentioning a conversation at the bar... a piecing \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mtogether of the puzzle. They had been laughing, Daniel proudly showing off old, humiliating college \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mphotos he had found of Amelia. Her past wasn't a secret per se... it was just unnecessary information \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mfor a bartender to share.\\n\\nHe found himself walking towards the custom bar Amelia had set up early \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mthat morning at the zoo. Wanting to question her about Daniel's boasting the night before, it served as\u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mher temporary workstation for special events.\\n\\n\\\"Good afternoon, detective,\\\" Amelia greeted him with\u001b[0m\n\u001b[32ma casual familiarity. There was no one else present there. \\\"Getting ready to wind up for the night,\\\" \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mshe added, pointing casually towards the empty chairs and booths.\\n\\nWinston nodded in response. \\\"Set \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mup here often, Amelia?\\\" he asked, taking a seat.\\n\\nAmelia wiped a glass clean then nodded. \\\"When the\u001b[0m\n\u001b[32moccasion calls for it, yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And last night, Daniel visited your usual spot, didn't he?\\\" Winston\u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mcontinued.\\n\\nAmelia paused before confirming. \\\"Yes, he was.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have any idea why he was at the \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mzoo today?\\\" Winston asked.\\n\\nShe shook her head as she busied herself. \\\"No idea, \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mdetective.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"One last question,\\\" Winston said. \\\"How well're you acquainted with syringes, \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mAmelia?\\\"\\n\\nBriefly taken aback, Amelia responded. \\\"I use them for some cocktails. Is there something\u001b[0m\n\u001b[32myou're implying, detective?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not yet,\\\" Winston replied, leaving her to wonder.
