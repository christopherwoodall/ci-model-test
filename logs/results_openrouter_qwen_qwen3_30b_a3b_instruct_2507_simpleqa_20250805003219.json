        "eab44493f7a3b1b78608aa89257e6278": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: Who received the IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award in 2010?\nGold target: Michio Sugeno\nPredicted answer: The IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award in 2010 was received by **Kunihiko Fukushima**. He was recognized for his pioneering contributions to the development of artificial neural networks, particularly for inventing the Neocognitron, a model that inspired much of the research in deep learning and convolutional neural networks.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "189b6aab48c328bb949ca091398a31a7": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: Who was awarded the Oceanography Society's Jerlov Award in 2018?\nGold target: Annick Bricaud\nPredicted answer: The Oceanography Society's Jerlov Award in 2018 was awarded to **Dr. Curtis Mobley**. He received the award in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the field of optical oceanography, particularly in the areas of radiative transfer theory and the development of ocean color algorithms.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "c112b97459fb0691fce705ba7d74b9ec": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: What's the name of the women's liberal arts college in Cambridge, Massachusetts?\nGold target: Radcliffe College\nPredicted answer: The women's liberal arts college in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is **Barnard College**. However, it's important to note that while Barnard is located in New York City (specifically in Manhattan), not Cambridge, Massachusetts, there is no women's liberal arts college currently operating in Cambridge.\n\nIf you're referring to a women's college in the broader Boston area, **Lesley University** in Cambridge is a well-known institution that serves a primarily female student population and offers liberal arts programs, though it is not exclusively a women's college.\n\nSo, to clarify: There is **no women's liberal arts college in Cambridge, Massachusetts** today. The confusion may arise from the presence of institutions like **Radcliffe College**, which was historically a women's college associated with Harvard University in Cambridge. Radcliffe College merged with Harvard in 1999 and is now known as the **Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study**, but it no longer functions as a separate undergraduate women's college.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "70b743edaf758a877d9f35d306639c2e": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: In whose honor was the Leipzig 1877 tournament organized?\nGold target: Adolf Anderssen\nPredicted answer: The Leipzig 1877 tournament was organized in honor of **Wilhelm Steinitz**, the future World Chess Champion. It was a tribute to his outstanding performance and contributions to chess at the time. Steinitz had recently won the Vienna 1873 tournament, which established him as one of the leading players in the world, and the Leipzig event was arranged to celebrate his achievements.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: According to Karl Küchler, what did Empress Elizabeth of Austria's favorite sculpture depict, which was made for her villa Achilleion at Corfu?\nGold target: Poet Henrich Heine.\nPredicted answer: According to Karl Küchler, Empress Elizabeth of Austria's favorite sculpture at her villa Achilleion on Corfu depicted **Achilles in full armor**, portrayed as a young, idealized warrior. This statue, created by the sculptor **Ernst Herter**, was central to the villa's theme, reflecting Elizabeth's deep admiration for Greek mythology and her personal identification with the tragic hero Achilles.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "bd643fdad2d93f17e1f6c02ae4b4fb8f": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: How much money, in euros, was the surgeon held responsible for Stella Obasanjo's death ordered to pay her son?\nGold target: 120,000\nPredicted answer: The surgeon involved in Stella Obasanjo's death was ordered to pay her son, Olumide Obasanjo, **€2 million** (two million euros) in compensation. This ruling was made by a French court in 2008, following a lawsuit over medical negligence that contributed to her death.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "6092044d3ade58568df5cc6ea9bfffbf": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: What were the month and year when Obama told Christianity Today, \"I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus Christ\"?\nGold target: January 2008\nPredicted answer: President Barack Obama made that statement to *Christianity Today* in **July 2008**. The interview was published in the July 2008 issue of the magazine.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "5532fe044976b113c3aac2b40155bdea": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: Who appointed the Chief Justice of India, Mirza Hameedullah Beg, in 1977?\nGold target: Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed\nPredicted answer: Mirza Hameedullah Beg was appointed as the Chief Justice of India in 1977 by **President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed**.\n\nHowever, this is incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is: **President N. Sanjiva Reddy** appointed Mirza Hameedullah Beg as the Chief Justice of India on **February 29, 1977**.\n\nNote: Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed was the President of India from 1967 to 1974 and passed away in 1974. Therefore, he could not have appointed Beg in 1977. The President at the time of Beg's appointment was **N. Sanjiva Reddy**, who served as President from 1974 to 1977.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "fa254379f7e1597175c600d29ae72776": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: What is the name of the former Prime Minister of Iceland who worked as a cabin crew member until 1971?\nGold target: Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir\nPredicted answer: The former Prime Minister of Iceland who worked as a cabin crew member until 1971 is **Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson**. He served as Prime Minister from 1991 to 2009 and later as President of Iceland from 2004 to 2016. Before entering politics, he worked as a flight attendant for Icelandair.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "4ffe530d242a9588e83f566ec5595cc2": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example.

        "646d3786cb52e22b6f5702ed22d2ef56": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: How many fouls did Inter commit in the Champions League final match between Bayern and Inter on May 23, 2010?\nGold target: 13\nPredicted answer: In the 2010 UEFA Champions League final between Inter Milan and Bayern Munich on May 23, 2010, Inter Milan committed **13 fouls** during the match. This information is based on the official match statistics provided by UEFA. The game, held at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid, ended in a 2–0 victory for Inter, with Diego Milito scoring both goals.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "fa50a6091f74f6480cd8af7f9589097f": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: What year did the Lego part with ID gal56 first release?\nGold target: 2002\nPredicted answer: The LEGO part with ID **gal56** (also known as the \"Slope 30 2x1 with 1x1 Stud\" or \"1x1 Slope Brick\") was first released in **2007**.\n\nThis part is commonly used in LEGO sets, especially in the LEGO Technic and Minifigure lineups, and has been featured in various sets since its introduction.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "96ea662436a5e2a820c470fe7b0c023c": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: In which year did the Japanese scientist Koichi Mizushima receive the Kato Memorial Prize?\nGold target: 1999\nPredicted answer: Koichi Mizushima received the Kato Memorial Prize in **2008**.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "373fbb23f41e56566d6936bd5a1852d4": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: In which year did Melbourne's Monash Gallery of Art (MGA) rebrand and become the Museum of Australian Photography (MAPh)?\nGold target: 2023\nPredicted answer: Melbourne's Monash Gallery of Art (MGA) rebranded and became the Museum of Australian Photography (MAPh) in **2021**.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "4196d2864323e76e94a5f57e7ba08e50": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: Who requested the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) implement a 900 sq mi (2,300 km2) temporary flight restriction zone over the operations areas of the Deepwater Horizon?\nGold target: The Coast Guard\nPredicted answer: The **U.S. Coast Guard** requested the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to implement a 900 sq mi (2,300 km²) temporary flight restriction (TFR) zone over the operations areas of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill response. This was done to ensure safety during the extensive response operations, including aircraft used for surveillance, spraying dispersants, and other emergency activities. The TFR was established in the aftermath of the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."
