Winston fished the statement reports from his pile of case files, which stated that Kent and Julia were last seen together at the mosque.  Kent had been poisoned with snake venom, a tricky murder weapon to trace. His victim, Kent, was Julia\\'s cousin and had last been seen at the mosque with her before he met his unfortunate fate.\\\\n\\\\nHis next stop was clear. He pulled his coat close against the biting wind and snow. Silicon Valley, estate of one Julia. Inside, he found Julia embroiled in what seemed an exhaustive pile of legal documents. From their exchange, he learned that she was currently tangled up in a knotty lawsuit, where the opposing party had a good deal to gain, financially that is.\\\\n\\\\nStepping into what he could only describe as a mini laboratory, a brave new world peered back at him. Labeled samples cluttered the table, one of which was a snake venom sample. Julia was trained as a herpetologist and her job involved working with venomous snakes, she explained this to Winston while also showing him her work with venomous snakes.\\\\n\\\\nAs they moved past countless terrariums, Winston paused in front of a portrait on the mantel. \\\\u201cThat\\\\u2019s Kent,\\\\u201d Julia sighed. \\\\u201cAlways the favored one, especially by Grandpa. In his latest will, everything was left to him. The will was initially expected to be in my favor, but, he bypassed me completely,\\\\\" Julia said. Her voice turned bitter as she revealed these shocking discoveries about her cousin, Kent.\\\\n\\\\nChanging the topic to something less contentious, she mentioned that both of them used to frequent the same mosque for prayers, the very place where Kent was last seen alive by people, before she added, \\\\\"And we were together at the mosque that same day.\\\\\" Her tone hardened as she described an altercation with Kent she had had earlier that day at the mosque. The tension was palpable as she revealed her own cousin had been secretly helping the opposition in the ongoing legal battle.\\\\n\\\\nWinston nodded, took a few final notes, and bid his farewell, a gust of wind blowing in with the opening of the front door. His footsteps crunched the snow beneath his boots and the stark contrast of his solitary car in the vast white providence painted an odd yet mystic picture. As he drove off, the silhouette of Julia\\\\u2019s house receded, but the flicker of suspicion stayed kindled in his mind.\\\\n\\\\nWinston sauntered into the buzzing fairgrounds.

Winston fished the statement reports from his\u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mpile of case files, which stated that Kent and Julia were last seen together at the mosque.  Kent had \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mbeen poisoned with snake venom, a tricky murder weapon to trace. His victim, Kent, was Julia's cousin \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mand had last been seen at the mosque with her before he met his unfortunate fate.\\n\\nHis next stop was \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mclear. He pulled his coat close against the biting wind and snow. Silicon Valley, estate of one Julia. \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mInside, he found Julia embroiled in what seemed an exhaustive pile of legal documents. From their \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mexchange, he learned that she was currently tangled up in a knotty lawsuit, where the opposing party \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mhad a good deal to gain, financially that is.\\n\\nStepping into what he could only describe as a mini \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mlaboratory, a brave new world peered back at him. Labeled samples cluttered the table, one of which was\u001b[0m\n\u001b[32ma snake venom sample. Julia was trained as a herpetologist and her job involved working with venomous \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32msnakes, she explained this to Winston while also showing him her work with venomous snakes.\\n\\nAs they \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mmoved past countless terrariums, Winston paused in front of a portrait on the mantel. \\u201cThat\\u2019s\u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mKent,\\u201d Julia sighed. \\u201cAlways the favored one, especially by Grandpa. In his latest will, \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32meverything was left to him. The will was initially expected to be in my favor, but, he bypassed me \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mcompletely,\\\" Julia said. Her voice turned bitter as she revealed these shocking discoveries about her \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mcousin, Kent.\\n\\nChanging the topic to something less contentious, she mentioned that both of them used\u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mto frequent the same mosque for prayers, the very place where Kent was last seen alive by people, \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mbefore she added, \\\"And we were together at the mosque that same day.\\\" Her tone hardened as she \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mdescribed an altercation with Kent she had had earlier that day at the mosque. The tension was palpable\u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mas she revealed her own cousin had been secretly helping the opposition in the ongoing legal \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mbattle.\\n\\nWinston nodded, took a few final notes, and bid his farewell, a gust of wind blowing in with\u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mthe opening of the front door. His footsteps crunched the snow beneath his boots and the stark contrast\u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mof his solitary car in the vast white providence painted an odd yet mystic picture. As he drove off, \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mthe silhouette of Julia\\u2019s house receded, but the flicker of suspicion stayed kindled in his \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mmind.\\n\\nWinston sauntered into the buzzing fairgrounds. His worn Panama hat tilted, casting a shadow \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mover his contoured face as he surveyed the spectacle of the annual town fair. Ronald, the man he had \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mcome to see, was easy to spot - standing tall in his uniform as security for the event.\\n\\n\\\"Ronald?\\\" \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mWinston called out after weaving through the crowd of cotton-candy eaters and parched parents.\\n\\nA \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32msharp look from Ronald confirmed his identity.\\n\\nEver the expert at concealing his hand, Winston \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mlightly grazed the topic. \\\"I hear you\\u2019re pretty experienced with snakes. Handle 'em at the zoo, \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mright? A zoo with quite a variety of venomous snakes, so I've heard.\\\"\\n\\nA flicker of pride sparked in\u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mRonald's eyes. \\\"Yes, that's right. From rattlers to mambas, we have them all. I have the keys to all \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32manimal enclosures, even the Venomous Serpent Exhibit.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Must be quite a job, wrangling all those \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32msnakes,\\\" said Winston. \\\"Especially with the variety of venomous species you have. They can be lethal \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mwith their venom.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You bet. But it's all about understanding and respect,\\\" Ronald\\u2019s eyes \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mreflected the love for his job.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s when Winston changed tactics. He didn't have the luxury \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mof time; the fair was busy, and he sensed Ronald wouldn't stay guard at his post for long. \\n\\n\\\"I need\u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mto talk about some documents,\\\" he said. Before he even finished his sentence, the color drained from \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mRonald\\u2019s face. \\\"Documents linking you to past misdemeanors. They were found on a man named \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mKent.\\\"\\n\\nThe denial came swift and in violence. \\\"This is preposterous! That man was maligning me; I \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mdid nothing wrong!\\u201d\\n\\nA shrill kiddy ride whirled inches from them, momentarily deafening Winston\u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mto anything else Ronald had to say. By the time the wooden cars clattered to a stop, Ronald was \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32msprinting the other way. \\n\\nHe was no longer at his post, no longer within sight, and no longer within\u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mWinston\\u2019s reach for further questions. For now. The detective adjusted his hat, scanning the \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mfield. Winston knew he had started unraveling traces, but he\\u2019d need to tread carefully here on \u001b[0m\n\u001b[32mout.
