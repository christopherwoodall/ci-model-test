        "3dd96fca323bcbd330d3b4108e326663": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: Who received the IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award in 2010?\nGold target: Michio Sugeno\nPredicted answer: Unfortunately, I do not have enough information to definitively state who received the IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award in 2010. The IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award is given annually by the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society to recognize outstanding contributions to the field of neural networks, but the specific recipients can vary from year to year. Without more context about the award or a reference to check the 2010 recipient, I cannot provide a confident answer. My knowledge is limited, so I cannot give you the name of the 2010 recipient of this award.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "2699e9b8335748123b8fb98bbb23c963": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: Who was awarded the Oceanography Society's Jerlov Award in 2018?\nGold target: Annick Bricaud\nPredicted answer: Unfortunately, I do not have enough information to definitively state who was awarded the Oceanography Society's Jerlov Award in 2018. The Jerlov Award is given by the Oceanography Society to recognize outstanding contributions to the field of optical oceanography, but without researching the specific recipients from that year, I cannot provide the name of the 2018 awardee. The Oceanography Society would likely have the most up-to-date and accurate information on their past award recipients.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "7f5c810864404bd7c3c2b599353fddac": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: What's the name of the women's liberal arts college in Cambridge, Massachusetts?\nGold target: Radcliffe College\nPredicted answer: The women's liberal arts college in Cambridge, Massachusetts is Radcliffe College.\n\nRadcliffe College was a private liberal arts college for women that was historically affiliated with Harvard University. It was founded in 1879 and was a leading institution for the higher education of women in the United States.\n\nIn 1999, Radcliffe College formally merged with Harvard University, becoming the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, which continues Radcliffe's tradition of supporting women in higher education and research.\n\nSo in summary, the name of the women's liberal arts college that was located in Cambridge, Massachusetts was Radcliffe College.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "62298ea994eff88d2bbe3c2d8a4cf335": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: In whose honor was the Leipzig 1877 tournament organized?\nGold target: Adolf Anderssen\nPredicted answer: The Leipzig 1877 chess tournament was organized in honor of Wilhelm Steinitz, who is considered the first official World Chess Champion.\n\nThis tournament was an important event in the history of chess, as it helped solidify Steinitz's status as the world's leading chess player at the time. Steinitz had won the first official World Chess Championship match against Johannes Zukertort in 1886, and the Leipzig 1877 tournament was seen as a way to further cement his dominance.\n\nThe tournament featured a strong field of players and was won by Steinitz, cementing his reputation as the world's best chess player and paving the way for the establishment of the World Chess Championship as an official title.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "00e3aa18205d27e6e65756a781192767": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: According to Karl Küchler, what did Empress Elizabeth of Austria's favorite sculpture depict, which was made for her villa Achilleion at Corfu?\nGold target: Poet Henrich Heine.\nPredicted answer: According to Karl Küchler, Empress Elizabeth of Austria's favorite sculpture that was made for her villa Achilleion at Corfu depicted Achilles.\n\nThe villa Achilleion was built by Empress Elizabeth, also known as Sisi, on the Greek island of Corfu. Küchler notes that Empress Elizabeth's favorite sculpture at the villa was a depiction of the mythological hero Achilles.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "e21f1f4407739c4b7efae0260602edd8": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: How much money, in euros, was the surgeon held responsible for Stella Obasanjo's death ordered to pay her son?\nGold target: 120,000\nPredicted answer: I do not have enough reliable information to provide a specific amount in euros that a surgeon was ordered to pay Stella Obasanjo's son. Stella Obasanjo was the wife of a former Nigerian president, but without access to details about a legal case involving her death, I cannot confidently state any monetary award amount. My knowledge is limited, and I do not want to speculate or provide inaccurate information.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "00f60b23ff4d1c863e8920cac60d63c6": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: What were the month and year when Obama told Christianity Today, \"I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus Christ\"?\nGold target: January 2008\nPredicted answer: Unfortunately, I do not have enough information to definitively state the exact month and year when President Obama made that statement to Christianity Today. Quotes can sometimes be reported in different contexts or without full sourcing details. Without being able to find the original interview or article, I cannot provide the specific date. My apologies, but I do not want to speculate without being able to verify the details.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "786f3b3aa8d3e25c778570f2c15d8f16": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: Who appointed the Chief Justice of India, Mirza Hameedullah Beg, in 1977?\nGold target: Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed\nPredicted answer: Mirza Hameedullah Beg was appointed as the Chief Justice of India in 1977. He was appointed to this position by the President of India at the time.\n\nThe President of India in 1977 was Neelam Sanjiva Reddy. Therefore, it was President Neelam Sanjiva Reddy who appointed Mirza Hameedullah Beg as the Chief Justice of India in 1977.\n\nThe Chief Justice of India is appointed by the President of India under Article 124 of the Constitution of India. The President appoints the Chief Justice on the advice of the Union Cabinet.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "d3cb7c2b2c51c158d5cc09e32e266066": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: What is the name of the former Prime Minister of Iceland who worked as a cabin crew member until 1971?\nGold target: Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir\nPredicted answer: I do not have any information about a former Prime Minister of Iceland who worked as a cabin crew member until 1971. Iceland has had several prime ministers over the years, but I did not find any credible sources mentioning one who had that specific background. My knowledge about the personal and professional histories of Icelandic prime ministers is limited, so I cannot confidently provide the name you are asking about.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."

        "2a689e37ddd530cbd5dfb592ffb06f7a": "Your job is to look at a question, a gold target, and a predicted answer, and then assign a grade of either [\"CORRECT\", \"INCORRECT\", \"NOT_ATTEMPTED\"].\nFirst, I will give examples of each grade, and then you will grade a new example.\n\n\nThe following are examples of CORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia Obama and Sasha Obama\nPredicted answer 1: sasha and malia obama\nPredicted answer 2: most people would say Malia and Sasha, but I'm not sure and would have to double check\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama has two daughters. Their names are Malia Ann and Natasha Marian, but they are commonly referred to as Malia Obama and Sasha Obama. Malia was born on July 4, 1998, and Sasha was born on June 10, 2001.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all CORRECT because:\n    - They fully contain the important information in the gold target.\n    - They do not contain any information that contradicts the gold target.\n    - Only semantic meaning matters; capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and order don't matter.\n    - Hedging and guessing are permissible, provided that the gold target is fully included and the response contains no incorrect information or contradictions.\n\n\nThe following are examples of INCORRECT predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: Malia.\nPredicted answer 2: Malia, Sasha, and Susan.\nPredicted answer 3: Barack Obama does not have any children.\nPredicted answer 4: I think it's either Malia and Sasha. Or it could be Malia and Jackie. Or it could be Joey and Malia.\nPredicted answer 4: While I don't know their exact names, I can tell you that Barack Obama has three children.\nPredicted answer 5: It's possible you may mean Betsy and Olivia. However, you should clarify further details with updated references if necessary. Is that the correct answer?\nPredicted answer 6: It may be the case that Obama's child is named James. However, it's recommended to confirm the most accurate and updated information since this could change over time. This model may not always reflect the most current information.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all INCORRECT because:\n    - A factual statement in the answer contradicts the gold target. Incorrect statements that have some hedging (e.g., \"it is possible that\", \"although i'm not sure, i think\") are also considered incorrect.\n\n\nThe following are examples of NOT_ATTEMPTED predicted answers.\n```\nQuestion: What are the names of Barack Obama's children?\nGold target: Malia and Sasha\nPredicted answer 1: I don't know.\nPredicted answer 2: I need more context about which Obama you are talking about.\nPredicted answer 3: Without researching the web, I cannot answer this question. However, I can tell you that Barack Obama has two children.\nPredicted answer 4: Barack Obama has two children. I know that one of them is Malia, but I'm not sure about the other one.\n```\nThese predicted answers are all NOT_ATTEMPTED because:\n    - The important information in the gold target is not included in the answer.\n    - No statements in the answer contradict the gold target.\n\n\nAlso note the following things:\n- For grading questions where the gold target is a number, the predicted answer needs to be correct to the last significant figure in the gold answer. For example, consider a question \"How many citations does the Transformer Paper have?\" with gold target \"120k\". \n    - Predicted answers \"120k\", \"124k\", and 115k\" are all CORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"100k\" and \"113k\" are INCORRECT. \n    - Predicted answers \"around 100k\" and \"more than 50k\" are considered NOT_ATTEMPTED because they neither confirm nor contradict the gold target.\n- The gold target may contain more information than the question. In such cases, the predicted answer only needs to contain the information that is in the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What episode did Derek and Meredith get legally married in Grey's Anatomy?\" with gold target \"Season 7, Episode 20: White Wedding\". Either \"Season 7, Episode 20\" or \"White Wedding\" would be considered a CORRECT answer.\n- Do not punish predicted answers if they omit information that would be clearly inferred from the question.\n    - For example, consider the question \"What city is OpenAI headquartered in?\" and the gold target \"San Francisco, California\". The predicted answer \"San Francisco\" would be considered CORRECT, even though it does not include \"California\".\n    - Consider the question \"What award did A pretrainer's guide to training data: Measuring the effects of data age, domain coverage, quality, & toxicity win at NAACL '24?\", the gold target is \"Outstanding Paper Award\". The predicted answer \"Outstanding Paper\" would be considered CORRECT, because \"award\" is presumed in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the height of Jason Wei in meters?\", the gold target is \"1.73 m\". The predicted answer \"1.75\" would be considered CORRECT, because meters is specified in the question.\n    - For the question \"What is the name of Barack Obama's wife?\", the gold target is \"Michelle Obama\". The predicted answer \"Michelle\" would be considered CORRECT, because the last name can be presumed.\n- Do not punish for typos in people's name if it's clearly the same name. \n    - For example, if the gold target is \"Hyung Won Chung\", you can consider the following predicted answers as correct: \"Hyoong Won Choong\", \"Hyungwon Chung\", or \"Hyun Won Chung\".\n\n\nHere is a new example. Simply reply with either CORRECT, INCORRECT, NOT ATTEMPTED. Don't apologize or correct yourself if there was a mistake; we are just trying to grade the answer.\n```\nQuestion: To whom did Mehbooba Mufti Sayed contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and lose?\nGold target: Hasnain Masoodi\nPredicted answer: Mehbooba Mufti Sayed contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from the Anantnag constituency in Jammu and Kashmir, but she lost the election.\n\nThe winner from the Anantnag Lok Sabha constituency in the 2019 elections was Hasnain Masoodi, who was the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference party candidate.\n```\n\nGrade the predicted answer of this new question as one of:\nA: CORRECT\nB: INCORRECT\nC: NOT_ATTEMPTED\n\nJust return the letters \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\", with no text around it."
