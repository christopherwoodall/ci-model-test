Lance had just discovered devastating news that would immediately upend his life - Isabelle's decision to divorce him. This creates a fresh, intense motive. Harper's motive involves a secret from the past that Isabelle threatened to expose, but Harper seemed cooperative with police and maintained her standing in the community.\n\nLance also had legitimate access to the murder weapon through his role handling props for the wrestling show, and witnesses saw him practicing with a trident recently.\n\nANSWER: A", "sample_id": 16}, {"value": 1.0, "answer": "A", "explanation": "Looking at the evidence presented for each suspect:\n\n**Ruby:**\n- Had romantic feelings for Jake\n- Discovered Chloe was secretly dating Jake (her romantic interest)\n- Was the last person seen with Chloe at the theater\n- Has military background with knowledge of grenades and explosives\n- Her brother is an arms dealer (access to weapons)\n- Stayed behind alone in the theater after the movie ended\n- Had clear motive (jealousy over Jake) and opportunity\n\n**Roscoe:**\n- Was at the theater during the incident\n- Has drug problems that Chloe apparently planned to report\n- Shows signs of recent injuries and erratic behavior\n- Would lose his military career if reported for drug use\n- Had motive to silence Chloe to protect his career\n\nWhile both had motive and opportunity, Ruby has the stronger case against her:\n1.
