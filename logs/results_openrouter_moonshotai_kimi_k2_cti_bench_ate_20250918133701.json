          "content": "### Identification of MITRE Enterprise Attack Patterns\n\n1. **Remote Access Tool (RAT) - 3PARA RAT**  \n   - **Technique**: Remote Access Software (T1219)  \n   - **Reasoning**: The text explicitly describes 3PARA RAT as a \"remote access tool (RAT)\" developed in C++. This aligns with the MITRE technique T1219, which covers software used to remotely control systems.\n\n2. **Command and Control (C2) Communication via HTTP**  \n   - **Technique**: Application Layer Protocol (T1071)  \n   - **Reasoning**: The text states that 3PARA RAT communicates with C2 servers via HTTP. HTTP is an application layer protocol, making T1071 the correct mapping.\n\n3. **Encrypted Commands Using DES Algorithm**  \n   - **Technique**: Data Encoding (T1132)  \n   - **Reasoning**: The commands are encrypted using DES in CBC mode, which is a form of data encoding to obfuscate the content of the commands.

This aligns with the MITRE technique T1219, which covers software used to remotely control systems.\n\n2. **Command and Control (C2) Communication via HTTP**  \n   - **Technique**: Application Layer Protocol (T1071)  \n   - **Reasoning**: The text states that 3PARA RAT communicates with C2 servers via HTTP. HTTP is an application layer protocol, making T1071 the correct mapping.\n\n3. **Encrypted Commands Using DES Algorithm**  \n   - **Technique**: Data Encoding (T1132)  \n   - **Reasoning**: The commands are encrypted using DES in CBC mode, which is a form of data encoding to obfuscate the content of the commands. T1132 covers encoding data for C2 communications.\n\n4. **Fallback Decryption Using XOR Key**  \n   - **Technique**: Data Encoding (T1132)  \n   - **Reasoning**: If DES decryption fails, the tool falls back to an 8-byte XOR key for decoding. This is another instance of data encoding, reinforcing T1132.\n\n5. **File Metadata Retrieval and Directory Listing**  \n   - **Technique**: File and Directory Discovery (T1083)  \n   - **Reasoning**: The tool includes commands to retrieve file metadata and list the current working directory, which are actions associated with discovering files and directories (T1083).\n\n6. **Modification of File Attributes (Timestamps)**  \n   - **Technique**: Indicator Removal (T1070)  \n   - **Reasoning**: Modifying file creation and modification timestamps is a method to remove indicators of compromise, aligning with T1070.\n\n### Final Output (Main Technique IDs Only)\nT1219,T1071,T1132,T1083,T1070"

HTTP is an application layer protocol, making T1071 the correct mapping.\n\n3. **Encrypted Commands Using DES Algorithm**  \n   - **Technique**: Data Encoding (T1132)  \n   - **Reasoning**: The commands are encrypted using DES in CBC mode, which is a form of data encoding to obfuscate the content of the commands. T1132 covers encoding data for C2 communications.\n\n4. **Fallback Decryption Using XOR Key**  \n   - **Technique**: Data Encoding (T1132)  \n   - **Reasoning**: If DES decryption fails, the tool falls back to an 8-byte XOR key for decoding. This is another instance of data encoding, reinforcing T1132.\n\n5. **File Metadata Retrieval and Directory Listing**  \n   - **Technique**: File and Directory Discovery (T1083)  \n   - **Reasoning**: The tool includes commands to retrieve file metadata and list the current working directory, which are actions associated with discovering files and directories (T1083).\n\n6. **Modification of File Attributes (Timestamps)**  \n   - **Technique**: Indicator Removal (T1070)  \n   - **Reasoning**: Modifying file creation and modification timestamps is a method to remove indicators of compromise, aligning with T1070.\n\n### Final Output (Main Technique IDs Only)\nT1219,T1071,T1132,T1083,T1070"

It relies on HTTP for command and control (C2) communication and has the ability to create a remote shell. To obfuscate its C2 traffic, 4H RAT uses a 1-byte XOR encryption with the key 0xBE. The malware is capable of retrieving file and directory listings, as well as obtaining information about running processes and loaded modules. Additionally, 4H RAT includes an OS version identifier in its beacon messages."

It was found in 19 Android applications, with at least 7 exploiting known Android vulnerabilities to gain root permissions. While primarily affecting users in the United States, AbstractEmu’s reach extends to victims across 17 countries. The malware can modify system settings to grant itself device administrator privileges, monitor notifications, and communicate with its command and control (C2) server via HTTP. AbstractEmu can also grant itself microphone and camera permissions, access location data, and disable Play Protect. Additionally, it can collect extensive device information, including the manufacturer, model, version, serial number, telephone number, IP address, and SIM information. AbstractEmu can download and install additional malware post-infection, access call logs, intercept SMS messages containing two-factor authentication codes, and obtain a list of installed applications. The malware uses encoded shell scripts and exploit binaries to facilitate the rooting process and can silently gain permissions or install additional malware using rooting exploits.

T1404 – Exploitation for Privilege Escalation  \n   Reasoning: “At least 7 [apps] exploiting known Android vulnerabilities to gain root permissions.” Using OS-level exploits to obtain root clearly maps to privilege-escalation via exploitation.\n\n3. T1626 – Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism  \n   Reasoning: After gaining root, the malware “can modify system settings to grant itself device administrator privileges.” Abusing Android’s device-admin APIs to elevate or maintain elevated access fits this technique.\n\n4. T1517 – Access Notifications  \n   Reasoning: The malware explicitly “monitor[s] notifications,” which is the definition of this technique.\n\n5. T1437 – Application Layer Protocol  \n   Reasoning: It “communicate[s] with its command and control (C2) server via HTTP,” an application-layer protocol.\n\n6. T1429 – Audio Capture  \n   Reasoning: The malware “can grant itself microphone … permissions,” enabling audio capture.\n\n7. T1512 – Video Capture  \n   Reasoning: Likewise, it grants itself “camera permissions,” enabling video capture.\n\n8. T1430 – Location Tracking  \n   Reasoning: It “access[es] location data,” which is location tracking.\n\n9. T1629 – Impair Defenses  \n   Reasoning: It “disable[s] Play Protect,” a clear defense-impairment action.\n\n10. T1426 – System Information Discovery  \n    Reasoning: It “collect[s] extensive device information, including the manufacturer, model, version, serial number, telephone number, IP address, and SIM information.”\n\n11. T1418 – Software Discovery  \n    Reasoning: It “obtain[s] a list of installed applications,” which is software discovery.\n\n12. T1407 – Download New Code at Runtime  \n    Reasoning: It “can download and install additional malware post-infection,” i.e., dynamically fetch and execute new code.\n\n13. T1582 – SMS Control  \n    Reasoning: It “intercept[s] SMS messages containing two-factor authentication codes,” which is SMS interception/control.\n\n14. T1616 – Call Control  \n    Reasoning: It “access[es] call logs,” part of call-oriented information gathering/control.\n\n15. T1406 – Obfuscated Files or Information  \n    Reasoning: It “uses encoded shell scripts and exploit binaries” and employs “code abstraction” to hide its payloads.\n\n16. T1633 – Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion  \n    Reasoning: It performs “anti-emulation checks” to avoid dynamic analysis environments.\n\nFinal line (main technique IDs only, no sub-techniques):\n\nT1664,T1404,T1626,T1517,T1437,T1429,T1512,T1430,T1629,T1426,T1418,T1407,T1582,T1616,T1406,T1633"

T1664 – Exploitation for Initial Access  \n   Reasoning: The malware was “found in 19 Android applications” on Google Play and third-party stores. This indicates the adversary compromised legitimate applications (supply-chain style) and used them as the delivery vehicle for initial access.\n\n2. T1404 – Exploitation for Privilege Escalation  \n   Reasoning: “At least 7 [apps] exploiting known Android vulnerabilities to gain root permissions.” Using OS-level exploits to obtain root clearly maps to privilege-escalation via exploitation.\n\n3. T1626 – Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism  \n   Reasoning: After gaining root, the malware “can modify system settings to grant itself device administrator privileges.” Abusing Android’s device-admin APIs to elevate or maintain elevated access fits this technique.\n\n4. T1517 – Access Notifications  \n   Reasoning: The malware explicitly “monitor[s] notifications,” which is the definition of this technique.\n\n5. T1437 – Application Layer Protocol  \n   Reasoning: It “communicate[s] with its command and control (C2) server via HTTP,” an application-layer protocol.\n\n6. T1429 – Audio Capture  \n   Reasoning: The malware “can grant itself microphone … permissions,” enabling audio capture.\n\n7. T1512 – Video Capture  \n   Reasoning: Likewise, it grants itself “camera permissions,” enabling video capture.\n\n8. T1430 – Location Tracking  \n   Reasoning: It “access[es] location data,” which is location tracking.\n\n9. T1629 – Impair Defenses  \n   Reasoning: It “disable[s] Play Protect,” a clear defense-impairment action.\n\n10.

T1418 – Software Discovery  \n    Reasoning: It “obtain[s] a list of installed applications,” which is software discovery.\n\n12. T1407 – Download New Code at Runtime  \n    Reasoning: It “can download and install additional malware post-infection,” i.e., dynamically fetch and execute new code.\n\n13. T1582 – SMS Control  \n    Reasoning: It “intercept[s] SMS messages containing two-factor authentication codes,” which is SMS interception/control.\n\n14.

T1071 – Application Layer Protocol  \n   Reason: The backdoor “communicates with its command and control (C2) server via port 80 … exchanging data through HTTP POST requests.” HTTP is an application-layer protocol.\n\n2. T1573 – Encrypted Channel  \n   Reason: “Its C2 traffic is encrypted and then encoded with Base64.” Encrypting the channel is exactly what this technique describes.\n\n3. T1132 – Data Encoding  \n   Reason: After encryption, the traffic is “encoded with Base64,” which is a form of data encoding.\n\n4. T1041 – Exfiltration Over C2 Channel  \n   Reason: Data are exfiltrated to the C2 server over the same HTTP channel already used for command and control.\n\n5. T1560 – Archive Collected Data  \n   Reason: “Command execution output [is] stored in a .dat file in the %TEMP% directory” before exfiltration, indicating collected data are staged/archived locally.\n\n6. T1074 – Data Staged  \n   Reason: The .dat file in %TEMP% is a staging location for data prior to exfiltration.\n\n7. T1547 – Boot or Logon Autostart Execution  \n   Reason: “Persistence is achieved by adding itself to the HKCU\\…\\Run Registry key,” which is a Run key autostart mechanism.\n\n8. T1112 – Modify Registry  \n   Reason: The malware adds a value to the Registry Run key, thereby modifying the registry.\n\n9. T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter  \n   Reason: The backdoor “can create a remote shell and execute specified commands,” implying use of a command interpreter.\n\n10. T1106 – Native API  \n    Reason: The text explicitly states it “communicates … using the Wininet API,” a Windows native API.\n\n11. T1005 – Data from Local System  \n    Reason: The malware collects command output and other data from the local system.\n\n12. T1587 – Develop Capabilities  \n    Reason: ADVSTORESHELL itself is a custom backdoor developed by the adversary.\n\n13. T1588 – Obtain Capabilities  \n    Reason: APT28 obtained (developed or acquired) this backdoor capability.\n\n14.

T1573 – Encrypted Channel  \n   Reason: “Its C2 traffic is encrypted and then encoded with Base64.” Encrypting the channel is exactly what this technique describes.\n\n3. T1132 – Data Encoding  \n   Reason: After encryption, the traffic is “encoded with Base64,” which is a form of data encoding.\n\n4. T1041 – Exfiltration Over C2 Channel  \n   Reason: Data are exfiltrated to the C2 server over the same HTTP channel already used for command and control.\n\n5. T1560 – Archive Collected Data  \n   Reason: “Command execution output [is] stored in a .dat file in the %TEMP% directory” before exfiltration, indicating collected data are staged/archived locally.\n\n6. T1074 – Data Staged  \n   Reason: The .dat file in %TEMP% is a staging location for data prior to exfiltration.\n\n7. T1547 – Boot or Logon Autostart Execution  \n   Reason: “Persistence is achieved by adding itself to the HKCU\\…\\Run Registry key,” which is a Run key autostart mechanism.\n\n8. T1112 – Modify Registry  \n   Reason: The malware adds a value to the Registry Run key, thereby modifying the registry.\n\n9. T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter  \n   Reason: The backdoor “can create a remote shell and execute specified commands,” implying use of a command interpreter.\n\n10. T1106 – Native API  \n    Reason: The text explicitly states it “communicates … using the Wininet API,” a Windows native API.\n\n11. T1005 – Data from Local System  \n    Reason: The malware collects command output and other data from the local system.\n\n12.

Provide reasoning for each identification. Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** ADVSTORESHELL is a spying backdoor associated with APT28, active from at least 2012 to 2016. It is typically used for long-term espionage on targets identified as valuable after an initial reconnaissance phase. ADVSTORESHELL communicates with its command and control (C2) server via port 80 using the Wininet API, exchanging data through HTTP POST requests. Before exfiltration, the backdoor encrypts data using the 3DES algorithm with a hardcoded key. Persistence is achieved by adding itself to the HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run Registry key. ADVSTORESHELL can create a remote shell and execute specified commands, with command execution output stored in a .dat file in the %TEMP% directory. Its C2 traffic is encrypted and then encoded with Base64. Some variants of ADVSTORESHELL also use 3DES encryption for C2 communications.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1134 : Access

        "f87e1390c0971d1cdfb728b313d0d9d9": "ADVSTORESHELL is a spying backdoor associated with APT28, active from at least 2012 to 2016. It is typically used for long-term espionage on targets identified as valuable after an initial reconnaissance phase. ADVSTORESHELL communicates with its command and control (C2) server via port 80 using the Wininet API, exchanging data through HTTP POST requests. Before exfiltration, the backdoor encrypts data using the 3DES algorithm with a hardcoded key. Persistence is achieved by adding itself to the HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run Registry key. ADVSTORESHELL can create a remote shell and execute specified commands, with command execution output stored in a .dat file in the %TEMP% directory. Its C2 traffic is encrypted and then encoded with Base64. Some variants of ADVSTORESHELL also use 3DES encryption for C2 communications.",
        "f859830be8be7507eeb8213c764ccce6": "Here is the mapping of every MITRE Enterprise technique that can be inferred from the text, together with the reasoning for each choice.\n\n1. T1071 – Application Layer Protocol  \n   Reason: The backdoor “communicates with its command and control (C2) server via port 80 … exchanging data through HTTP POST requests.” HTTP is an application-layer protocol.\n\n2. T1573 – Encrypted Channel  \n   Reason: “Its C2 traffic is encrypted and then encoded with Base64.” Encrypting the channel is exactly what this technique describes.\n\n3. T1132 – Data Encoding  \n   Reason: After encryption, the traffic is “encoded with Base64,” which is a form of data encoding.\n\n4. T1041 – Exfiltration Over C2 Channel  \n   Reason: Data are exfiltrated to the C2 server over the same HTTP channel already used for command and control.\n\n5. T1560 – Archive Collected Data  \n   Reason: “Command execution output [is] stored in a .dat file in the %TEMP% directory” before exfiltration, indicating collected data are staged/archived locally.\n\n6. T1074 – Data Staged  \n   Reason: The .dat file in %TEMP% is a staging location for data prior to exfiltration.\n\n7. T1547 – Boot or Logon Autostart Execution  \n   Reason: “Persistence is achieved by adding itself to the HKCU\\…\\Run Registry key,” which is a Run key autostart mechanism.\n\n8. T1112 – Modify Registry  \n   Reason: The malware adds a value to the Registry Run key, thereby modifying the registry.\n\n9. T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter  \n   Reason: The backdoor “can create a remote shell and execute specified commands,” implying use of a command interpreter.\n\n10. T1106 – Native API  \n    Reason: The text explicitly states it “communicates … using the Wininet API,” a Windows native API.\n\n11. T1005 – Data from Local System  \n    Reason: The malware collects command output and other data from the local system.\n\n12. T1587 – Develop Capabilities  \n    Reason: ADVSTORESHELL itself is a custom backdoor developed by the adversary.\n\n13. T1588 – Obtain Capabilities  \n    Reason: APT28 obtained (developed or acquired) this backdoor capability.\n\n14. T1592 – Gather Victim Host Information  \n    Reason: The backdoor is deployed “after an initial reconnaissance phase” in which valuable targets are identified, implying host information gathering.\n\nFinal line (only main technique IDs, no sub-techniques):\n\nT1071,T1573,T1132,T1041,T1560,T1074,T1547,T1112,T1059,T1106,T1005,T1587,T1588,T1592"

By July 2019, Agent Smith had infected approximately 25 million devices, primarily targeting users in India, but also impacting other Asian countries, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Agent Smith can inject fraudulent ad modules into existing applications on a device and exploits known OS vulnerabilities, such as Janus, to replace legitimate apps with malicious versions. The malware is designed to display fraudulent ads to generate revenue. It can also hide its icon from the application launcher and delete update packages of infected apps to prevent them from being updated. The malware can impersonate any popular application on an infected device, with its core component disguising itself as a legitimate Google app. The dropper used to deliver Agent Smith is a weaponized version of a legitimate Feng Shui Bundle. Additionally, the core malware is disguised as a JPG file and encrypted with an XOR cipher.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1134

T1036 – Masquerading  \n   “its core component disguising itself as a legitimate Google app … disguised as a JPG file” shows the malware pretending to be something else to evade detection.\n\n3. T1027 – Obfuscated Files or Information  \n   “encrypted with an XOR cipher” is a classic file-content obfuscation technique.\n\n4. T1491 – Defacement  \n   “replacing legitimate apps … with malicious versions that contain fraudulent ads” alters the visual appearance/function of the victim’s apps, matching the “Defacement” technique.\n\n5. T1659 – Content Injection  \n   “inject fraudulent ad modules into existing applications” is the direct injection of new content (ads) into otherwise legitimate apps.\n\n6. T1070 – Indicator Removal on Host  \n   “delete update packages of infected apps to prevent them from being updated” removes artifacts that would reveal or remediate the infection.\n\n7. T1564 – Hide Artifacts  \n   “hide its icon from the application launcher” is an explicit attempt to hide its presence from the user.\n\n8. T1195 – Supply Chain Compromise  \n   “The dropper used to deliver Agent Smith is a weaponized version of a legitimate Feng Shui Bundle” shows compromise of trusted third-party software to reach targets.\n\nT1203,T1036,T1027,T1491,T1659,T1070,T1564,T1195"

Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** Agent Tesla is a spyware Trojan built on the .NET framework, active since at least 2014. It is capable of collecting account information from the victim’s machine and has been observed using HTTP for command and control (C2) communications. Agent Tesla can encrypt data using the 3DES algorithm before transmitting it to a C2 server. To establish persistence, it adds itself to the system Registry as a startup program. The Trojan can perform form-grabbing to capture data from web forms and is also capable of stealing data from the victim’s clipboard. Additionally, Agent Tesla can extract credentials from FTP clients and wireless profiles. It has the ability to decrypt strings that have been encrypted using the Rijndael symmetric encryption algorithm.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation

It gained notoriety for infecting U.S. military networks in 2008. The worm gathers system information and saves it in an XML file, which is then XOR-encoded for obfuscation. On any connected USB flash drive, Agent.btz creates a file named \"thumb.dd\" that contains details about the infected system and activity logs. The worm also attempts to download an encrypted binary from a specified domain. To propagate itself, Agent.btz drops a copy of itself onto removable media and creates an autorun.inf file that instructs the system to execute the malware when the device is inserted into another computer. Additionally, Agent.btz collects network-related information, including the IP and MAC addresses of the network adapter, as well as IP addresses for the default gateway, WINS, DHCP, and DNS servers, and saves this data into a log file. The worm also records the victim's username and stores it in a separate file.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1134 : Access

Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** Agent.btz is a worm known for spreading primarily through removable devices like USB drives. It gained notoriety for infecting U.S. military networks in 2008. The worm gathers system information and saves it in an XML file, which is then XOR-encoded for obfuscation. On any connected USB flash drive, Agent.btz creates a file named \"thumb.dd\" that contains details about the infected system and activity logs. The worm also attempts to download an encrypted binary from a specified domain. To propagate itself, Agent.btz drops a copy of itself onto removable media and creates an autorun.inf file that instructs the system to execute the malware when the device is inserted into another computer. Additionally, Agent.btz collects network-related information, including the IP and MAC addresses of the network adapter, as well as IP addresses for the default gateway, WINS, DHCP, and DNS servers, and saves this data into a log file. The worm also records the victim's username and stores it in a separate file.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1134 : Access

MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** Agent.btz is a worm known for spreading primarily through removable devices like USB drives. It gained notoriety for infecting U.S. military networks in 2008. The worm gathers system information and saves it in an XML file, which is then XOR-encoded for obfuscation. On any connected USB flash drive, Agent.btz creates a file named \"thumb.dd\" that contains details about the infected system and activity logs. The worm also attempts to download an encrypted binary from a specified domain. To propagate itself, Agent.btz drops a copy of itself onto removable media and creates an autorun.inf file that instructs the system to execute the malware when the device is inserted into another computer. Additionally, Agent.btz collects network-related information, including the IP and MAC addresses of the network adapter, as well as IP addresses for the default gateway, WINS, DHCP, and DNS servers, and saves this data into a log file. The worm also records the victim's username and stores it in a separate file.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1134 : Access

It began spreading in August 2022 through an update to the previously benign app \"iRecorder – Screen Recorder,\" which was originally released on the Google Play Store in September 2021. AhRat is capable of communicating with its command and control (C2) server via HTTPS requests. It can record audio using the device’s microphone and register with the BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast to start automatically when the device is powered on. AhRat can search for and exfiltrate files with specific extensions, such as .jpg, .mp4, .html, .docx, and .pdf, as well as enumerate files stored on external storage. Additionally, it can register with the CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE and WIFI_STATE_CHANGED broadcast events to trigger further functionality.

After each mapping I give the reasoning that links the behavior to the technique.\n\n1. “record audio using the device’s microphone”  \n   → T1429 – Audio Capture  \n   Reasoning: Direct use of the microphone to capture audio matches the definition of Audio Capture.\n\n2. “register with the BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast to start automatically when the device is powered on”  \n   → T1398 – Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts  \n   Reasoning: Leveraging the BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast is a classic Android method for executing code at boot, which falls under Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts.\n\n3. “search for and exfiltrate files with specific extensions … enumerate files stored on external storage”  \n   → T1420 – File and Directory Discovery  \n   Reasoning: Enumerating files and directories (including external storage) is exactly what File and Directory Discovery describes.\n\n4. “exfiltrate collected data … to the C2 server”  \n   → T1646 – Exfiltration Over C2 Channel  \n   Reasoning: Sending the gathered data back through the same command-and-control channel is defined as Exfiltration Over C2 Channel.\n\n5. “track the device’s location”  \n   → T1430 – Location Tracking  \n   Reasoning: Actively determining and monitoring the device’s physical location is Location Tracking.\n\n6. “communicating with its command and control (C2) server via HTTPS requests”  \n   → T1521 – Encrypted Channel  \n   Reasoning: Using HTTPS (an encrypted protocol) for C2 traffic is categorized as Encrypted Channel.\n\n7. “register with the CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE and WIFI_STATE_CHANGED broadcast events to trigger further functionality”  \n   → T1624 – Event Triggered Execution  \n   Reasoning: Using system broadcast events (CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE, WIFI_STATE_CHANGED) to trigger code execution is Event Triggered Execution.\n\n8. “began spreading … through an update to the previously benign app … on the Google Play Store”  \n   → T1474 – Supply Chain Compromise  \n   Reasoning: Delivering malicious code via a legitimate application update distributed through an official store is a textbook Supply Chain Compromise.\n\nFinal list of main technique IDs only (no sub-techniques):\n\nT1429,T1398,T1420,T1646,T1430,T1521,T1624,T1474"

It communicates with its command and control (C2) servers via HTTP and uses fast flux DNS to evade detection. Amadey can collect information from compromised hosts and send the data to its C2 servers. To maintain persistence, it overwrites registry keys, changing the Startup folder to the one containing its executable. Amadey is capable of decoding antivirus name strings and searching for folders associated with antivirus software. Additionally, it can download and execute files to further infect the host machine with additional malware. The Trojan employs various Windows API calls, such as GetComputerNameA, GetUserNameA, and CreateProcessA, and obfuscates strings related to antivirus vendors, domains, and files to avoid detection.

It communicates with its command and control (C2) servers via HTTP and uses fast flux DNS to evade detection. Amadey can collect information from compromised hosts and send the data to its C2 servers. To maintain persistence, it overwrites registry keys, changing the Startup folder to the one containing its executable. Amadey is capable of decoding antivirus name strings and searching for folders associated with antivirus software. Additionally, it can download and execute files to further infect the host machine with additional malware. The Trojan employs various Windows API calls, such as GetComputerNameA, GetUserNameA, and CreateProcessA, and obfuscates strings related to antivirus vendors, domains, and files to avoid detection.

              "description": "Amadey is a Trojan bot that has been active since at least October 2018. It communicates with its command and control (C2) servers via HTTP and uses fast flux DNS to evade detection. Amadey can collect information from compromised hosts and send the data to its C2 servers. To maintain persistence, it overwrites registry keys, changing the Startup folder to the one containing its executable. Amadey is capable of decoding antivirus name strings and searching for folders associated with antivirus software. Additionally, it can download and execute files to further infect the host machine with additional malware. The Trojan employs various Windows API calls, such as GetComputerNameA, GetUserNameA, and CreateProcessA, and obfuscates strings related to antivirus vendors, domains, and files to avoid detection."

It communicates with its command and control (C2) servers using HTTP, HTTPS, and in some variants, DNS tunneling. Anchor can establish persistence by creating a service and is capable of terminating itself if specific execution flags are not present. The malware uses cmd.exe to execute its self-deletion routine and can hide files using the NTFS file system. After successful deployment, Anchor can self-delete its dropper and is also able to download additional payloads. Additionally, it can utilize secondary C2 servers for communication after relaying victim information to the primary C2 servers.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 :

Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** Anchor is a backdoor malware that has been deployed alongside TrickBot on select high-profile targets since at least 2018. It communicates with its command and control (C2) servers using HTTP, HTTPS, and in some variants, DNS tunneling. Anchor can establish persistence by creating a service and is capable of terminating itself if specific execution flags are not present. The malware uses cmd.exe to execute its self-deletion routine and can hide files using the NTFS file system. After successful deployment, Anchor can self-delete its dropper and is also able to download additional payloads. Additionally, it can utilize secondary C2 servers for communication after relaying victim information to the primary C2 servers.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 :

        "56710a2030da3745e48af948a9973b5d": "Here is the step-by-step mapping of every relevant MITRE Enterprise technique mentioned (or strongly implied) in the text, together with the reasoning for each choice.\n\n1. T1071 – Application Layer Protocol  \n   Reason: “It communicates with its command and control (C2) servers using HTTP, HTTPS …” HTTP/HTTPS are classic application-layer C2 channels.\n\n2. T1572 – Protocol Tunneling  \n   Reason: “… and in some variants, DNS tunneling.” DNS tunneling is a textbook example of protocol tunneling for C2.\n\n3. T1543 – Create or Modify System Process  \n   Reason: “Anchor can establish persistence by creating a service …” Creating a Windows service is the canonical way to achieve this technique.\n\n4. T1105 – Ingress Tool Transfer  \n   Reason: “… is also able to download additional payloads.” Downloading new tools or payloads from C2 maps directly to Ingress Tool Transfer.\n\n5. T1070 – Indicator Removal  \n   Reason: “… can self-delete its dropper …” and “… execute its self-deletion routine …” Self-deletion of files/droppers is a form of indicator removal on host.\n\n6. T1564 – Hide Artifacts  \n   Reason: “… can hide files using the NTFS file system.” Explicitly hiding files via NTFS attributes or alternate data streams falls under Hide Artifacts.\n\n7. T1008 – Fallback Channels  \n   Reason: “Additionally, it can utilize secondary C2 servers for communication after relaying victim information to the primary C2 servers.” Using secondary/backup C2 channels is the definition of Fallback Channels.\n\n8. T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter  \n   Reason: “The malware uses cmd.exe to execute its self-deletion routine …” Invoking cmd.exe to run commands is a use of the Windows Command and Scripting Interpreter.\n\nFinal line with only the main technique IDs (no sub-techniques):\n\nT1071,T1572,T1543,T1105,T1070,T1564,T1008,T1059"

It communicates with its command and control (C2) server via HTTP and registers to receive the BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast intent, allowing it to activate upon device startup. The adware generates revenue by automatically displaying ads. To avoid detection, Android/AdDisplay.Ashas can hide its icon and create a shortcut based on instructions from the C2 server. It also mimics Facebook and Google icons on the \"Recent apps\" screen and uses a com.google.xxx package name to further evade identification. The C2 server address is concealed using base-64 encoding. Additionally, Android/AdDisplay.Ashas checks the number of installed apps, specifically looking for Facebook or FB Messenger. It collects various device information, including device type, OS version, language, free storage space, battery status, root status, and whether developer mode is enabled. The adware also ensures that the device's IP is not within known Google IP ranges before triggering its payload and can delay payload deployment to avoid detection during testing and to prevent association with unwanted ads.  **List of All MITRE Mobile technique IDs** ID    : Name T1626 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1517 : Access Notifications T1640 : Account Access Removal T1638 : Adversary-in-the-Middle T1437 : Application Layer Protocol T1661 : Application Versioning T1532 : Archive Collected Data T1429 : Audio Capture T1398 : Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts T1616 : Call Control T1414 : Clipboard Data T1623 : Command and Scripting Interpreter T1577 : Compromise Application Executable T1645 : Compromise Client Software Binary T1634 : Credentials from Password Store T1662 : Data Destruction T1471 : Data Encrypted for Impact T1533 : Data from Local System T1641 : Data Manipulation T1407 : Download New Code at Runtime T1456 : Drive-By Compromise T1637 : Dynamic Resolution T1521 : Encrypted Channel T1642 : Endpoint Denial of Service T1624 : Event Triggered Execution T1627 : Execution Guardrails T1639 : Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol T1646 : Exfiltration Over C2 Channel T1658 : Exploitation for Client Execution T1664 : Exploitation for Initial Access T1404 : Exploitation for Privilege Escalation T1428 : Exploitation of Remote Services T1420 : File and Directory Discovery T1541 : Foreground Persistence T1643 : Generate Traffic from Victim T1628 : Hide Artifacts T1625 : Hijack Execution Flow T1617 : Hooking T1629 : Impair Defenses T1630 : Indicator Removal on Host T1544 : Ingress Tool Transfer T1417 : Input Capture T1516 : Input Injection T1430 : Location Tracking T1461 : Lockscreen Bypass T1655 : Masquerading T1575 : Native API T1464 : Network Denial of Service T1423 : Network Service Scanning T1509 : Non-Standard Port T1406 : Obfuscated Files or Information T1644 : Out of Band Data T1660 : Phishing T1424 : Process Discovery T1631 : Process Injection T1636 : Protected User Data T1604 : Proxy Through Victim T1663 : Remote Access Software T1458 : Replication Through Removable Media T1603 : Scheduled Task/Job T1513 : Screen Capture T1582 : SMS Control T1418 : Software Discovery T1635 : Steal Application Access Token T1409 : Stored Application Data T1632 : Subvert Trust Controls T1474 : Supply Chain Compromise T1426 : System Information Discovery T1422 : System Network Configuration Discovery T1421 : System Network Connections Discovery T1512 : Video Capture T1633 : Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion T1481 : Web Service     ",

It collects various device information, including device type, OS version, language, free storage space, battery status, root status, and whether developer mode is enabled. The adware also ensures that the device's IP is not within known Google IP ranges before triggering its payload and can delay payload deployment to avoid detection during testing and to prevent association with unwanted ads."

T1624 – Event Triggered Execution**\n- **Reasoning**: The adware registers to receive the `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast intent, which triggers its execution upon device startup. This aligns with the technique of executing code in response to system events.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. T1437 – Application Layer Protocol**\n- **Reasoning**: The adware communicates with its C2 server via HTTP, which is an application-layer protocol. This matches the technique of using standard protocols for C2 communication.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. T1407 – Download New Code at Runtime**\n- **Reasoning**: The adware can receive instructions from the C2 server (e.g., to hide its icon or create a shortcut), implying it dynamically fetches new code or configurations at runtime.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. T1628 – Hide Artifacts**\n- **Reasoning**: The adware hides its icon, creates deceptive shortcuts, and mimics Facebook/Google icons to evade detection. This is a form of hiding its presence and artifacts on the device.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. T1655 – Masquerading**\n- **Reasoning**: The adware uses a `com.google.xxx` package name and mimics legitimate app icons (Facebook, Google) to appear trustworthy. This is a classic masquerading technique.\n\n---\n\n#### **6. T1406 – Obfuscated Files or Information**\n- **Reasoning**: The C2 server address is concealed using base-64 encoding, which is a form of obfuscation to hide critical information.\n\n---\n\n#### **7. T1426 – System Information Discovery**\n- **Reasoning**: The adware collects extensive device information (OS version, root status, battery, storage, etc.), which falls under system information discovery.\n\n---\n\n#### **8. T1633 – Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**\n- **Reasoning**: The adware checks if the device’s IP is within known Google IP ranges (likely to avoid detection in emulators or sandboxes) and delays payload deployment to evade analysis. This aligns with sandbox evasion techniques.\n\n---\n\n#### **9. T1544 – Ingress Tool Transfer**\n- **Reasoning**: While not explicitly stated, the adware’s ability to receive instructions or payloads from the C2 server implies it may transfer additional tools or code to the device.\n\n---\n\n### Final Output (Main Technique IDs Only)\nT1624,T1437,T1407,T1628,T1655,T1406,T1426,T1633,T1544"

During the 2022 C0026 campaign, threat actors re-registered expired ANDROMEDA command and control (C2) domains to deliver malware to targeted entities in Ukraine.

It can also download additional payloads from its C2 server. The malware has been observed installing itself to `C:\\Temp\\TrustedInstaller.exe`, masquerading as a legitimate Windows installer service, and has been delivered through LNK files disguised as folders.

This malware is capable of exfiltrating data encrypted with RC4 via its ransomware module and can also record phone calls and audio, as well as make phone calls.  Anubis includes a ransomware module that can encrypt device data and hold it for ransom, while also exfiltrating the encrypted files from the device. Additionally, it can modify external storage and download attacker-specified APK files. To resist uninstallation, Anubis exploits the Android performGlobalAction(int) API call. The malware features a keylogger that functions across all applications on the device and can track the device’s GPS location.

This malware, attributed to the Lazarus Group, has targeted organizations in various sectors, including energy, finance, government, technology, and telecommunications, across multiple countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, South Korea, Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, and Russia. AppleJeus has been used to distribute the FALLCHILL Remote Access Trojan (RAT). AppleJeus has the capability to present a User Account Control (UAC) prompt to elevate privileges during installation. It communicates with its command and control (C2) server via POST requests and uses shell scripts to execute commands and establish persistence after installation. The malware can install itself as a service and has been observed decoding files received from its C2 server. During installation, AppleJeus uses post-installation scripts to extract a hidden plist file from the application's /Resources folder, which is then executed as a Launch Daemon with elevated permissions. Additionally, it exfiltrates collected host information to its C2 server.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1134 : Access Token

Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** AppleJeus is a malware family of downloaders first discovered in 2018, embedded within trojanized cryptocurrency applications. This malware, attributed to the Lazarus Group, has targeted organizations in various sectors, including energy, finance, government, technology, and telecommunications, across multiple countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, South Korea, Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, and Russia. AppleJeus has been used to distribute the FALLCHILL Remote Access Trojan (RAT). AppleJeus has the capability to present a User Account Control (UAC) prompt to elevate privileges during installation. It communicates with its command and control (C2) server via POST requests and uses shell scripts to execute commands and establish persistence after installation. The malware can install itself as a service and has been observed decoding files received from its C2 server. During installation, AppleJeus uses post-installation scripts to extract a hidden plist file from the application's /Resources folder, which is then executed as a Launch Daemon with elevated permissions. Additionally, it exfiltrates collected host information to its C2 server.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1134 : Access Token

This malware, attributed to the Lazarus Group, has targeted organizations in various sectors, including energy, finance, government, technology, and telecommunications, across multiple countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, South Korea, Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, and Russia. AppleJeus has been used to distribute the FALLCHILL Remote Access Trojan (RAT). AppleJeus has the capability to present a User Account Control (UAC) prompt to elevate privileges during installation. It communicates with its command and control (C2) server via POST requests and uses shell scripts to execute commands and establish persistence after installation. The malware can install itself as a service and has been observed decoding files received from its C2 server. During installation, AppleJeus uses post-installation scripts to extract a hidden plist file from the application's /Resources folder, which is then executed as a Launch Daemon with elevated permissions. Additionally, it exfiltrates collected host information to its C2 server.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1134 : Access Token

MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** AppleSeed is a backdoor used by the Kimsuky group to target South Korean government, academic, and commercial entities since at least 2021.  AppleSeed can escalate its privileges to the system level by passing the SeDebugPrivilege to the AdjustTokenPrivilege API. It communicates with its command and control (C2) server over HTTP and compresses collected data before exfiltration. The malware is capable of automatically gathering data from USB drives, keystrokes, and screen captures prior to exfiltration. For persistence, AppleSeed creates the Registry key `EstsoftAutoUpdate` at `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce`. It can also execute its payload via PowerShell, collect data from compromised hosts, and locate and extract information from removable media devices.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID

AppleSeed can escalate its privileges to the system level by passing the SeDebugPrivilege to the AdjustTokenPrivilege API. It communicates with its command and control (C2) server over HTTP and compresses collected data before exfiltration. The malware is capable of automatically gathering data from USB drives, keystrokes, and screen captures prior to exfiltration. For persistence, AppleSeed creates the Registry key `EstsoftAutoUpdate` at `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce`. It can also execute its payload via PowerShell, collect data from compromised hosts, and locate and extract information from removable media devices.",

MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** AuTo Stealer is malware written in C++ that has been used by SideCopy since at least December 2021 to target government agencies and personnel in India and Afghanistan. AuTo Stealer communicates with its command and control (C2) servers using HTTP or TCP. It maintains persistence by placing malicious executables in the AutoRun registry key or StartUp directory, depending on the installed antivirus (AV) product. The malware can execute a batch file using `cmd.exe`. AuTo Stealer is capable of collecting various types of data from an infected machine, including PowerPoint files, Word documents, Excel files, PDF files, text files, database files, and image files. This collected data is stored in a file named `Hostname_UserName.txt` before exfiltration. The malware then exfiltrates the data to actor-controlled C2 servers via HTTP or TCP. Additionally, AuTo Stealer can gather information about the installed AV products on an infected host.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control

It was frequently deployed via weaponized .pps files exploiting CVE-2014-6352. This malware leverages the legitimate AutoIt scripting language, designed for Windows GUI automation, for malicious purposes. The AutoIt backdoor attempts to escalate privileges by bypassing User Account Control (UAC). It downloads a PowerShell script that decodes into a standard shellcode loader and communicates with its command and control (C2) server using base64-encoded responses. Additionally, the backdoor is capable of identifying and targeting documents on the victim's system with specific extensions, including .doc, .pdf, .csv, .ppt, .docx, .pst, .xls, .xlsx, .pptx, and

MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** The AutoIt backdoor is malware used by the threat actors behind the MONSOON campaign. It was frequently deployed via weaponized .pps files exploiting CVE-2014-6352. This malware leverages the legitimate AutoIt scripting language, designed for Windows GUI automation, for malicious purposes. The AutoIt backdoor attempts to escalate privileges by bypassing User Account Control (UAC). It downloads a PowerShell script that decodes into a standard shellcode loader and communicates with its command and control (C2) server using base64-encoded responses. Additionally, the backdoor is capable of identifying and targeting documents on the victim's system with specific extensions, including .doc, .pdf, .csv, .ppt, .docx, .pst, .xls, .xlsx, .pptx, and

This malware leverages the legitimate AutoIt scripting language, designed for Windows GUI automation, for malicious purposes. The AutoIt backdoor attempts to escalate privileges by bypassing User Account Control (UAC). It downloads a PowerShell script that decodes into a standard shellcode loader and communicates with its command and control (C2) server using base64-encoded responses. Additionally, the backdoor is capable of identifying and targeting documents on the victim's system with specific extensions, including .doc, .pdf, .csv, .ppt, .docx, .pst, .xls, .xlsx, .pptx, and .jpeg."

T1566 – Phishing  \n   Reason: The malware is “deployed via weaponized .pps files”. A malicious PowerPoint Show file sent to a victim is a classic phishing delivery mechanism.\n\n2. T1203 – Exploitation for Client Execution  \n   Reason: The .pps files “exploit CVE-2014-6352” to achieve code execution on the victim’s workstation.\n\n3. T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter  \n   Reason: The backdoor “leverages the legitimate AutoIt scripting language” to execute its own malicious scripts.\n\n4. T1548 – Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism  \n   Reason: The malware “attempts to escalate privileges by bypassing User Account Control (UAC)”, which is explicitly described in MITRE as T1548.\n\n5. T1105 – Ingress Tool Transfer  \n   Reason: The backdoor “downloads a PowerShell script” from an external source, satisfying the definition of transferring tools into the victim environment.\n\n6. T1059.001 – Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell (sub-technique)  \n   Reason: The downloaded payload is a PowerShell script that subsequently executes. While the parent technique T1059 is already listed, the sub-technique is also clearly present.\n\n7. T1140 – Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information  \n   Reason: The PowerShell script “decodes into a standard shellcode loader”, indicating an in-memory decoding step.\n\n8. T1071 – Application Layer Protocol  \n   Reason: The malware “communicates with its command and control (C2) server using base64-encoded responses”, which is an application-layer C2 protocol.\n\n9. T1132 – Data Encoding  \n   Reason: C2 traffic is “base64-encoded”, a form of data encoding for command and control.\n\n10. T1005 – Data from Local System  \n    Reason: The backdoor “identifies and targets documents on the victim’s system with specific extensions”, which is collection of data stored locally.\n\nFinal line containing only the main technique IDs (no sub-technique IDs):\n\nT1566,T1203,T1059,T1548,T1105,T1140,T1071,T1132,T1005",

T1573 – Encrypted Channel  \n   All C2 traffic is done “securely over TLS”, i.e., an encrypted channel is used to hide communications.\n\n4. T1559 – Inter-Process Communication  \n   PITSTOP listens on a Unix domain socket (`/data/runtime/cockpit/wd.fd`) and also “duplicate[s] the socket” created by PITHOOK, showing explicit use of IPC for command reception and relay.\n\n5. T1105 – Ingress Tool Transfer  \n   The implant itself (PITSTOP) is deployed on the compromised appliance, implying the adversary transferred this tool into the environment.\n\n6. T1580 – Cloud Infrastructure Discovery  \n   The campaign targets Ivanti Connect Secure VPN appliances, which are cloud-/edge-infrastructure components; deploying a backdoor on them implies prior discovery of this cloud infrastructure.\n\n7.

MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** PITSTOP is a backdoor deployed on compromised Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs during the Cutting Edge campaign, enabling command execution and file read/write operations. PITSTOP can receive shell commands over a Unix domain socket and deobfuscate base64 encoded and AES encrypted commands. It communicates securely over TLS and listens on the Unix domain socket located at `/data/runtime/cockpit/wd.fd`. Additionally, PITSTOP can evaluate incoming commands on the domain socket created by the PITHOOK malware, specifically searching for a predefined magic byte sequence, and then duplicate the socket for

PITSTOP can receive shell commands over a Unix domain socket and deobfuscate base64 encoded and AES encrypted commands. It communicates securely over TLS and listens on the Unix domain socket located at `/data/runtime/cockpit/wd.fd`. Additionally, PITSTOP can evaluate incoming commands on the domain socket created by the PITHOOK malware, specifically searching for a predefined magic byte sequence, and then duplicate the socket for further communication over TLS.",

T1140 – Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information  \n   The implant “deobfuscate[s] base64 encoded and AES encrypted commands” before execution, matching this defense-evasion technique.\n\n3. T1573 – Encrypted Channel  \n   All C2 traffic is done “securely over TLS”, i.e., an encrypted channel is used to hide communications.\n\n4. T1559 – Inter-Process Communication  \n   PITSTOP listens on a Unix domain socket (`/data/runtime/cockpit/wd.fd`) and also “duplicate[s] the socket” created by PITHOOK, showing explicit use of IPC for command reception and relay.\n\n5. T1105 – Ingress Tool Transfer  \n   The implant itself (PITSTOP) is deployed on the compromised appliance, implying the adversary transferred this tool into the environment.\n\n6. T1580 – Cloud Infrastructure Discovery  \n   The campaign targets Ivanti Connect Secure VPN appliances, which are cloud-/edge-infrastructure components; deploying a backdoor on them implies prior discovery of this cloud infrastructure.\n\n7. T1071 – Application Layer Protocol  \n   Communication “over TLS” is an application-layer protocol (HTTPS) used for C2.\n\nFinal main-technique IDs (no sub-techniques):\n\nT1059,T1140,T1573,T1559,T1105,T1580,T1071"

Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** DarkGate, first identified in 2018, has evolved into a versatile tool used in various criminal cyber operations, including initial access, data gathering, credential theft, cryptomining, cryptotheft, and pre-ransomware activities. Written in Delphi and named by its author, DarkGate has seen a significant increase in use since 2022 and is actively being developed as a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) offering. DarkGate employs two distinct User Account Control (UAC) bypass techniques to escalate privileges and utilizes parent PID spoofing as part of its \"rootkit-like\" features to evade detection by tools like Task Manager or Process Explorer. During execution, the malware elevates accounts it creates to the local administrator group. The command and control (C2) infrastructure of DarkGate includes hard-coded domains designed to mimic legitimate services like Akamai CDN or Amazon Web Services. It also disguises C2 traffic within DNS records associated with legitimate services to evade reputation-based detection. DarkGate is capable of searching for cryptocurrency wallets by scanning application window names for specific strings and uses the FindWindow API function to extract data collected via NirSoft tools from the hosting process's memory. When stored credentials linked to cryptocurrency wallets are identified, DarkGate alerts its C2 server.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control

T1548 – Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism  \n   Reason: “DarkGate employs two distinct User Account Control (UAC) bypass techniques to escalate privileges.”\n\n2. T1134 – Access Token Manipulation  \n   Reason: “utilizes parent PID spoofing … to evade detection.” Parent PID spoofing is a form of manipulating access tokens (T1134).\n\n3. T1055 – Process Injection  \n   Reason: Parent PID spoofing is often paired with process injection to run code inside a chosen parent process, matching the description of “rootkit-like” features.\n\n4. T1562 – Impair Defenses  \n   Reason: The malware’s “rootkit-like” features (e.g., hiding from Task Manager/Process Explorer) are designed to impair or evade security tools.\n\n5. T1136 – Create Account  \n   Reason: “the malware elevates accounts it creates to the local administrator group.”\n\n6. T1098 – Account Manipulation  \n   Reason: After creating accounts, DarkGate adds them to the local administrators group—an explicit manipulation of account permissions.\n\n7. T1071 – Application Layer Protocol  \n   Reason: C2 traffic is disguised within DNS records, indicating use of standard application-layer protocols (DNS) for command and control.\n\n8. T1568 – Dynamic Resolution  \n   Reason: The use of “hard-coded domains” that mimic legitimate CDNs implies dynamic resolution techniques to locate C2 infrastructure.\n\n9. T1102 – Web Service  \n   Reason: C2 domains are crafted to “mimic legitimate services like Akamai CDN or Amazon Web Services,” leveraging web services for command and control.\n\n10. T1005 – Data from Local System  \n    Reason: DarkGate “search[es] for cryptocurrency wallets by scanning application window names” and extracts data from the hosting process’s memory—collecting data stored on the local system.\n\n11. T1010 – Application Window Discovery  \n    Reason: It “scan[s] application window names for specific strings” to locate cryptocurrency wallets, which is application-window discovery.\n\n12. T1555 – Credentials from Password Stores  \n    Reason: It uses NirSoft tools to extract stored credentials (password stores) related to cryptocurrency wallets.\n\n13. T1105 – Ingress Tool Transfer  \n    Reason: The malware must first transfer NirSoft tools (or similar utilities) onto the victim host before using them.\n\n14. T1041 – Exfiltration Over C2 Channel  \n    Reason: “When stored credentials … are identified, DarkGate alerts its C2 server,” indicating exfiltration of the discovered data over the same C2 channel.\n\n15. T1657 – Financial Theft  \n    Reason: The entire workflow of locating and exfiltrating cryptocurrency wallet credentials is aimed at financial theft.\n\nFinal line (only main technique IDs, no sub-techniques):\n\nT1548,T1134,T1055,T1562,T1136,T1098,T1071,T1568,T1102,T1005,T1010,T1555,T1105,T1041,T1657"

Provide reasoning for each identification. Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** DarkGate, first identified in 2018, has evolved into a versatile tool used in various criminal cyber operations, including initial access, data gathering, credential theft, cryptomining, cryptotheft, and pre-ransomware activities. Written in Delphi and named by its author, DarkGate has seen a significant increase in use since 2022 and is actively being developed as a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) offering. DarkGate employs two distinct User Account Control (UAC) bypass techniques to escalate privileges and utilizes parent PID spoofing as part of its \"rootkit-like\" features to evade detection by tools like Task Manager or Process Explorer. During execution, the malware elevates accounts it creates to the local administrator group. The command and control (C2) infrastructure of DarkGate includes hard-coded domains designed to mimic legitimate services like Akamai CDN or Amazon Web Services. It also disguises C2 traffic within DNS records associated with legitimate services to evade reputation-based detection. DarkGate is capable of searching for cryptocurrency wallets by scanning application window names for specific strings and uses the FindWindow API function to extract data collected via NirSoft tools from the hosting process's memory. When stored credentials linked to cryptocurrency wallets are identified, DarkGate alerts its C2 server.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control

        "1fa4702129944c010a8ae8b86544ef85": "DarkGate, first identified in 2018, has evolved into a versatile tool used in various criminal cyber operations, including initial access, data gathering, credential theft, cryptomining, cryptotheft, and pre-ransomware activities. Written in Delphi and named by its author, DarkGate has seen a significant increase in use since 2022 and is actively being developed as a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) offering. DarkGate employs two distinct User Account Control (UAC) bypass techniques to escalate privileges and utilizes parent PID spoofing as part of its \"rootkit-like\" features to evade detection by tools like Task Manager or Process Explorer. During execution, the malware elevates accounts it creates to the local administrator group. The command and control (C2) infrastructure of DarkGate includes hard-coded domains designed to mimic legitimate services like Akamai CDN or Amazon Web Services. It also disguises C2 traffic within DNS records associated with legitimate services to evade reputation-based detection. DarkGate is capable of searching for cryptocurrency wallets by scanning application window names for specific strings and uses the FindWindow API function to extract data collected via NirSoft tools from the hosting process's memory. When stored credentials linked to cryptocurrency wallets are identified, DarkGate alerts its C2 server.",
        "d50a22de0241022352363441066ba691": "Here is a step-by-step mapping of every MITRE Enterprise technique that can be inferred from the text, together with the reasoning for each identification.\n\n1. T1548 – Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism  \n   Reason: “DarkGate employs two distinct User Account Control (UAC) bypass techniques to escalate privileges.”\n\n2. T1134 – Access Token Manipulation  \n   Reason: “utilizes parent PID spoofing … to evade detection.” Parent PID spoofing is a form of manipulating access tokens (T1134).\n\n3. T1055 – Process Injection  \n   Reason: Parent PID spoofing is often paired with process injection to run code inside a chosen parent process, matching the description of “rootkit-like” features.\n\n4. T1562 – Impair Defenses  \n   Reason: The malware’s “rootkit-like” features (e.g., hiding from Task Manager/Process Explorer) are designed to impair or evade security tools.\n\n5. T1136 – Create Account  \n   Reason: “the malware elevates accounts it creates to the local administrator group.”\n\n6. T1098 – Account Manipulation  \n   Reason: After creating accounts, DarkGate adds them to the local administrators group—an explicit manipulation of account permissions.\n\n7. T1071 – Application Layer Protocol  \n   Reason: C2 traffic is disguised within DNS records, indicating use of standard application-layer protocols (DNS) for command and control.\n\n8. T1568 – Dynamic Resolution  \n   Reason: The use of “hard-coded domains” that mimic legitimate CDNs implies dynamic resolution techniques to locate C2 infrastructure.\n\n9. T1102 – Web Service  \n   Reason: C2 domains are crafted to “mimic legitimate services like Akamai CDN or Amazon Web Services,” leveraging web services for command and control.\n\n10. T1005 – Data from Local System  \n    Reason: DarkGate “search[es] for cryptocurrency wallets by scanning application window names” and extracts data from the hosting process’s memory—collecting data stored on the local system.\n\n11. T1010 – Application Window Discovery  \n    Reason: It “scan[s] application window names for specific strings” to locate cryptocurrency wallets, which is application-window discovery.\n\n12. T1555 – Credentials from Password Stores  \n    Reason: It uses NirSoft tools to extract stored credentials (password stores) related to cryptocurrency wallets.\n\n13. T1105 – Ingress Tool Transfer  \n    Reason: The malware must first transfer NirSoft tools (or similar utilities) onto the victim host before using them.\n\n14. T1041 – Exfiltration Over C2 Channel  \n    Reason: “When stored credentials … are identified, DarkGate alerts its C2 server,” indicating exfiltration of the discovered data over the same C2 channel.\n\n15. T1657 – Financial Theft  \n    Reason: The entire workflow of locating and exfiltrating cryptocurrency wallet credentials is aimed at financial theft.\n\nFinal line (only main technique IDs, no sub-techniques):\n\nT1548,T1134,T1055,T1562,T1136,T1098,T1071,T1568,T1102,T1005,T1010,T1555,T1105,T1041,T1657"

          "content": "Here is the mapping of every relevant MITRE Enterprise technique mentioned or implied in the text, together with the reasoning for each identification.\n\n1. T1071 – Application Layer Protocol  \n   Reasoning: The backdoor “beacons to the NKN network via an HTTP POST request.” HTTP is an application-layer protocol, so this activity falls under T1071.\n\n2. T1573 – Encrypted Channel  \n   Reasoning: NGLite “uses an AES-encrypted channel for C2 communication,” which is exactly the behavior described by T1573.\n\n3. T1102 – Web Service  \n   Reasoning: The malware leverages the legitimate NKN (New Kind of Network) infrastructure—a decentralized web-like service—for its C2. Abusing such a public web service maps to T1102.\n\n4. T1082 – System Information Discovery  \n   Reasoning: NGLite “executes the ‘whoami’ command to collect system information and transmit it back to the C2 server,” which is classic system-information discovery.\n\n5. T1033 – System Owner/User Discovery  \n   Reasoning: Running “whoami” also reveals the current user context, satisfying T1033.\n\n6. T1016 – System Network Configuration Discovery  \n   Reasoning: The malware “identifies the victim system’s … IPv4 address,” which is part of enumerating the local network configuration.\n\n7. T1124 – System Time Discovery (implied)  \n   Reasoning: While not explicitly stated, beaconing malware almost always checks the local system time to embed in messages or to schedule tasks; this is a common companion to other discovery techniques.\n\n8.

MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** NGLite is a backdoor Trojan designed to execute commands received through its command and control (C2) channel. While its capabilities are typical for a backdoor, NGLite stands out for using a novel C2 channel that leverages a decentralized network based on the legitimate NKN (New Kind of Network) protocol for communication between the backdoor and threat actors. NGLite initially beacons to the NKN network via an HTTP POST request over TCP port 30003. It uses an AES-encrypted channel for C2 communication, with one observed instance employing the encryption key \"WHATswrongwithUu.\" NGLite abuses NKN infrastructure to facilitate its C2 communication. It identifies the victim system's MAC and IPv4 addresses to establish a unique victim identifier. Additionally, NGLite executes the \"whoami\" command to collect system information and transmit it back to the C2 server.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse

        "1e21fac1f69393c23fca47a68c72abed": "NGLite is a backdoor Trojan designed to execute commands received through its command and control (C2) channel. While its capabilities are typical for a backdoor, NGLite stands out for using a novel C2 channel that leverages a decentralized network based on the legitimate NKN (New Kind of Network) protocol for communication between the backdoor and threat actors. NGLite initially beacons to the NKN network via an HTTP POST request over TCP port 30003. It uses an AES-encrypted channel for C2 communication, with one observed instance employing the encryption key \"WHATswrongwithUu.\" NGLite abuses NKN infrastructure to facilitate its C2 communication. It identifies the victim system's MAC and IPv4 addresses to establish a unique victim identifier. Additionally, NGLite executes the \"whoami\" command to collect system information and transmit it back to the C2 server.",
        "e856d4a45ecec43f7d99d6cb852fd7bc": "Here is the mapping of every relevant MITRE Enterprise technique mentioned or implied in the text, together with the reasoning for each identification.\n\n1. T1071 – Application Layer Protocol  \n   Reasoning: The backdoor “beacons to the NKN network via an HTTP POST request.” HTTP is an application-layer protocol, so this activity falls under T1071.\n\n2. T1573 – Encrypted Channel  \n   Reasoning: NGLite “uses an AES-encrypted channel for C2 communication,” which is exactly the behavior described by T1573.\n\n3. T1102 – Web Service  \n   Reasoning: The malware leverages the legitimate NKN (New Kind of Network) infrastructure—a decentralized web-like service—for its C2. Abusing such a public web service maps to T1102.\n\n4. T1082 – System Information Discovery  \n   Reasoning: NGLite “executes the ‘whoami’ command to collect system information and transmit it back to the C2 server,” which is classic system-information discovery.\n\n5. T1033 – System Owner/User Discovery  \n   Reasoning: Running “whoami” also reveals the current user context, satisfying T1033.\n\n6. T1016 – System Network Configuration Discovery  \n   Reasoning: The malware “identifies the victim system’s … IPv4 address,” which is part of enumerating the local network configuration.\n\n7. T1124 – System Time Discovery (implied)  \n   Reasoning: While not explicitly stated, beaconing malware almost always checks the local system time to embed in messages or to schedule tasks; this is a common companion to other discovery techniques.\n\n8. T1571 – Non-Standard Port  \n   Reasoning: The initial beacon is sent “over TCP port 30003,” which is not a standard HTTP(S) port (80/443), matching T1571.\n\n9. T1041 – Exfiltration Over C2 Channel  \n   Reasoning: After collecting system information, NGLite “transmit[s] it back to the C2 server” using the same channel, which is exfiltration over the C2 channel.\n\n10. T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter  \n    Reasoning: The backdoor “execute[s] commands received through its command and control (C2) channel,” implying use of a local command interpreter (cmd, PowerShell, sh, etc.).\n\n11. T1105 – Ingress Tool Transfer  \n    Reasoning: Although not detailed, a backdoor that can execute arbitrary commands is typically used to download and run additional tools, which is T1105.\n\nIDs for the main techniques (no sub-techniques):  \nT1071,T1573,T1102,T1082,T1033,T1016,T1124,T1571,T1041,T1059,T1105"

Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** SocGholish is a JavaScript-based loader malware that has been active since at least 2017. It has been used in global attacks across various sectors, primarily gaining initial access through drive-by downloads disguised as software updates. Operated by Mustard Tempest, SocGholish’s access has been sold to groups like Indrik Spider for deploying secondary payloads, including remote access Trojans (RATs) and ransomware. SocGholish is executed as a JavaScript payload and can write the output of the `whoami` command to a local temp file using the naming convention `rad<5-hex-chars>.tmp`. It profiles compromised systems to identify domain trust relationships and is often distributed through compromised websites that present malicious content as browser updates.  The malware can exfiltrate data directly to its command and control (C2) server via HTTP and is capable of downloading additional malware onto infected hosts. SocGholish has been named `AutoUpdater.js` to mimic legitimate update files and is frequently delivered within compressed ZIP archives. It also employs single or double Base64 encoding for references to its second-stage server URLs. Additionally, SocGholish has been spread via emails containing malicious links.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1134 : Access

Provide reasoning for each identification. Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** SocGholish is a JavaScript-based loader malware that has been active since at least 2017. It has been used in global attacks across various sectors, primarily gaining initial access through drive-by downloads disguised as software updates. Operated by Mustard Tempest, SocGholish’s access has been sold to groups like Indrik Spider for deploying secondary payloads, including remote access Trojans (RATs) and ransomware. SocGholish is executed as a JavaScript payload and can write the output of the `whoami` command to a local temp file using the naming convention `rad<5-hex-chars>.tmp`. It profiles compromised systems to identify domain trust relationships and is often distributed through compromised websites that present malicious content as browser updates.  The malware can exfiltrate data directly to its command and control (C2) server via HTTP and is capable of downloading additional malware onto infected hosts. SocGholish has been named `AutoUpdater.js` to mimic legitimate update files and is frequently delivered within compressed ZIP archives. It also employs single or double Base64 encoding for references to its second-stage server URLs. Additionally, SocGholish has been spread via emails containing malicious links.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1134 : Access

It has been used in global attacks across various sectors, primarily gaining initial access through drive-by downloads disguised as software updates. Operated by Mustard Tempest, SocGholish’s access has been sold to groups like Indrik Spider for deploying secondary payloads, including remote access Trojans (RATs) and ransomware. SocGholish is executed as a JavaScript payload and can write the output of the `whoami` command to a local temp file using the naming convention `rad<5-hex-chars>.tmp`. It profiles compromised systems to identify domain trust relationships and is often distributed through compromised websites that present malicious content as browser updates.  The malware can exfiltrate data directly to its command and control (C2) server via HTTP and is capable of downloading additional malware onto infected hosts. SocGholish has been named `AutoUpdater.js` to mimic legitimate update files and is frequently delivered within compressed ZIP archives. It also employs single or double Base64 encoding for references to its second-stage server URLs. Additionally, SocGholish has been spread via emails containing malicious links.",
        "b8005e9e3858cc6d186f46db98efe240": "Identified MITRE Enterprise techniques and reasoning:\n\n1. **T1189 – Drive-by Compromise**  \n   Reasoning: The text states SocGholish gains “initial access through drive-by downloads disguised as software updates” and is “distributed through compromised websites that present malicious content as browser updates.”\n\n2. **T1204 – User Execution**  \n   Reasoning: Victims must manually execute the JavaScript payload (e.g., clicking on fake browser-update prompts or opening ZIP archives), which aligns with user-assisted execution.\n\n3. **T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter**  \n   Reasoning: SocGholish is described as a “JavaScript-based loader malware” that runs JavaScript code on the host, fitting the use of scripting interpreters.\n\n4. **T1082 – System Information Discovery**  \n   Reasoning: The malware “profiles compromised systems to identify domain trust relationships,” indicating collection of system-level information.\n\n5. **T1482 – Domain Trust Discovery**  \n   Reasoning: Explicitly mentioned: it “profiles … to identify domain trust relationships.”\n\n6. **T1105 – Ingress Tool Transfer**  \n   Reasoning: SocGholish “is capable of downloading additional malware onto infected hosts,” which is tool transfer from C2 to victim.\n\n7. **T1041 – Exfiltration Over C2 Channel**  \n   Reasoning: The malware “can exfiltrate data directly to its command and control (C2) server via HTTP,” matching exfiltration over the same channel used for C2.\n\n8. **T1027 – Obfuscated Files or Information**  \n   Reasoning: SocGholish “employs single or double Base64 encoding for references to its second-stage server URLs,” indicating obfuscation.\n\n9. **T1036 – Masquerading**  \n   Reasoning: The malware is named `AutoUpdater.js` to mimic legitimate update files and is delivered inside ZIP archives, disguising its true nature.\n\n10. **T1566 – Phishing**  \n    Reasoning: The text notes SocGholish “has been spread via emails containing malicious links,” which is phishing for initial access.\n\nFinal technique IDs (main techniques only, no subtechniques):\n\nT1189,T1204,T1059,T1082,T1482,T1105,T1041,T1027,T1036,T1566"

OneDrive is a cloud storage service, and exfiltration via HTTP POST to such services aligns with the technique \"Exfiltration Over Web Service\" (T1567).\n\n#### 2. **Data from Local System (T1005)**\n- **Reasoning**: Pcexter can search for files within specified directories on compromised systems, indicating it collects data from the local system. This matches the technique \"Data from Local System\" (T1005).\n\n#### 3. **Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105)**\n- **Reasoning**: Pcexter is described as an uploader used by ToddyCat, implying it is transferred into the compromised environment. This aligns with \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1105), which involves tools or files being transferred into a victim network.\n\n#### 4. **Hijack Execution Flow (T1574)**\n- **Reasoning**: Pcexter is distributed and executed as a DLL file (`Vspmsg.dll`) through DLL side-loading. DLL side-loading is a method of hijacking the execution flow of a legitimate process to load a malicious DLL, which falls under \"Hijack Execution Flow\" (T1574).\n\n### Final Output\nThe main technique IDs identified are: **T1567, T1005, T1105, T1574**"

SLIGHTPULSE can process HTTP GET requests like a normal web server while inserting logic to read or write files and execute commands in response to HTTP POST requests. It also has the capability to execute arbitrary commands passed to it and can base64 encode all incoming and outgoing command and control (C2) messages. The web shell can read files from the local system and pipe the output of executed commands to `/tmp/1`. Additionally, SLIGHTPULSE can deobfuscate and encrypt C2 messages using base64 encoding and RC4 encryption."

MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** STEADYPULSE is a web shell that targets Pulse Secure VPN servers by modifying a legitimate Perl script. It has been used since at least 2020, including in attacks against U.S. Defense Industrial Base (DIB) entities. STEADYPULSE can parse incoming web requests to determine the next steps in its execution and transmit data over its command and control (C2) channel using URL encoding. It is also capable of URL decoding key/value pairs received over C2. The web shell can modify Perl scripts on the targeted server to import additional Perl modules and enable the execution of arbitrary commands on compromised web servers.  **List of All MITRE

MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** COATHANGER is a remote access tool (RAT) designed to target FortiGate networking appliances. It was first deployed in 2023 in targeted intrusions against military and government entities in the Netherlands and other locations. Disclosed in early 2024, COATHANGER has been attributed with high confidence to a state-sponsored entity in the People's Republic of China. The malware uses an HTTP GET request to establish a follow-on TLS tunnel for command and control (C2) communication. COATHANGER provides a BusyBox reverse shell for C2 operations and creates a daemon for timed check-ins with the C2 infrastructure. It decodes configuration items from a bundled file to facilitate C2 activity and connects to the C2 infrastructure using SSL. The malware is installed after exploiting a vulnerable FortiGate device and surveys the contents of system files during installation. COATHANGER sets the GID of `httpsd` to 90 upon infection, installs itself into a hidden directory, and removes and writes malicious shared objects that replace legitimate system functions such as `read(2)`.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1134 : Access Token Manipulation T1531 : Account Access Removal T1087 : Account

Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** COATHANGER is a remote access tool (RAT) designed to target FortiGate networking appliances. It was first deployed in 2023 in targeted intrusions against military and government entities in the Netherlands and other locations. Disclosed in early 2024, COATHANGER has been attributed with high confidence to a state-sponsored entity in the People's Republic of China. The malware uses an HTTP GET request to establish a follow-on TLS tunnel for command and control (C2) communication. COATHANGER provides a BusyBox reverse shell for C2 operations and creates a daemon for timed check-ins with the C2 infrastructure. It decodes configuration items from a bundled file to facilitate C2 activity and connects to the C2 infrastructure using SSL. The malware is installed after exploiting a vulnerable FortiGate device and surveys the contents of system files during installation. COATHANGER sets the GID of `httpsd` to 90 upon infection, installs itself into a hidden directory, and removes and writes malicious shared objects that replace legitimate system functions such as `read(2)`.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1134 : Access Token Manipulation T1531 : Account Access Removal T1087 : Account

              "description": "COATHANGER is a remote access tool (RAT) designed to target FortiGate networking appliances. It was first deployed in 2023 in targeted intrusions against military and government entities in the Netherlands and other locations. Disclosed in early 2024, COATHANGER has been attributed with high confidence to a state-sponsored entity in the People's Republic of China. The malware uses an HTTP GET request to establish a follow-on TLS tunnel for command and control (C2) communication. COATHANGER provides a BusyBox reverse shell for C2 operations and creates a daemon for timed check-ins with the C2 infrastructure. It decodes configuration items from a bundled file to facilitate C2 activity and connects to the C2 infrastructure using SSL. The malware is installed after exploiting a vulnerable FortiGate device and surveys the contents of system files during installation. COATHANGER sets the GID of `httpsd` to 90 upon infection, installs itself into a hidden directory, and removes and writes malicious shared objects that replace legitimate system functions such as `read(2)`."

This aligns with exploiting a public-facing application to gain initial access.\n\n#### 2. **Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware (COATHANGER) is transferred to the target system after exploitation, which is a classic example of transferring tools into the environment.\n\n#### 3. **Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware provides a BusyBox reverse shell, which is a command-line interface for executing commands. This falls under the use of a command and scripting interpreter.\n\n#### 4. **Application Layer Protocol (T1071)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware uses HTTP GET requests and TLS tunnels for C2 communication, which are application-layer protocols (HTTP/HTTPS).\n\n#### 5. **Encrypted Channel (T1573)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware connects to C2 infrastructure using SSL/TLS, which is an encrypted channel for secure communication.\n\n#### 6. **Create or Modify System Process (T1543)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware creates a daemon for timed check-ins with the C2 infrastructure, which involves creating or modifying a system process.\n\n#### 7. **Hide Artifacts (T1564)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware installs itself into a hidden directory and replaces legitimate system functions (e.g., `read(2)`), which is a form of hiding artifacts.\n\n#### 8. **Masquerading (T1036)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware replaces legitimate shared objects (e.g., `read(2)`) with malicious ones, masquerading as legitimate system functions.\n\n#### 9. **Rootkit (T1014)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware replaces system functions like `read(2)` with malicious shared objects, which is characteristic of rootkit behavior (hooking or replacing system calls).\n\n#### 10. **System Information Discovery (T1082)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware surveys the contents of system files during installation, which is a form of system information discovery.\n\n#### 11. **Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware decodes configuration items from a bundled file, which implies obfuscation or encoding of data.\n\n---\n\n### Final Output (Main Technique IDs Only)\n1190,1105,1059,1071,1573,1543,1564,1036,1014,1082,1027",

This aligns with exploiting a public-facing application to gain initial access.\n\n#### 2. **Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware (COATHANGER) is transferred to the target system after exploitation, which is a classic example of transferring tools into the environment.\n\n#### 3. **Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware provides a BusyBox reverse shell, which is a command-line interface for executing commands. This falls under the use of a command and scripting interpreter.\n\n#### 4. **Application Layer Protocol (T1071)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware uses HTTP GET requests and TLS tunnels for C2 communication, which are application-layer protocols (HTTP/HTTPS).\n\n#### 5. **Encrypted Channel (T1573)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware connects to C2 infrastructure using SSL/TLS, which is an encrypted channel for secure communication.\n\n#### 6. **Create or Modify System Process (T1543)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware creates a daemon for timed check-ins with the C2 infrastructure, which involves creating or modifying a system process.\n\n#### 7. **Hide Artifacts (T1564)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware installs itself into a hidden directory and replaces legitimate system functions (e.g., `read(2)`), which is a form of hiding artifacts.\n\n#### 8. **Masquerading (T1036)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware replaces legitimate shared objects (e.g., `read(2)`) with malicious ones, masquerading as legitimate system functions.\n\n#### 9. **Rootkit (T1014)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware replaces system functions like `read(2)` with malicious shared objects, which is characteristic of rootkit behavior (hooking or replacing system calls).\n\n#### 10. **System Information Discovery (T1082)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware surveys the contents of system files during installation, which is a form of system information discovery.\n\n#### 11. **Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware decodes configuration items from a bundled file, which implies obfuscation or encoding of data.\n\n---\n\n### Final Output (Main Technique IDs Only)\n1190,1105,1059,1071,1573,1543,1564,1036,1014,1082,1027"

It was deployed during the Cutting Edge campaign to compromise Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs. WARPWIRE operates as a credential harvester written in JavaScript and can embed itself into legitimate files on compromised Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs. It Base64 encodes captured credentials using `btoa()` before transmitting them to its command and control (C2) server. The stolen credentials are sent via HTTP GET or POST requests.

It was deployed during the Cutting Edge campaign to compromise Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs. WARPWIRE operates as a credential harvester written in JavaScript and can embed itself into legitimate files on compromised Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs. It Base64 encodes captured credentials using `btoa()` before transmitting them to its command and control (C2) server. The stolen credentials are sent via HTTP GET or POST requests.

It was deployed during the Cutting Edge campaign to compromise Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs. WARPWIRE operates as a credential harvester written in JavaScript and can embed itself into legitimate files on compromised Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs. It Base64 encodes captured credentials using `btoa()` before transmitting them to its command and control (C2) server. The stolen credentials are sent via HTTP GET or POST requests. Additionally, WARPWIRE can intercept credentials submitted during the web logon process, enabling access to layer seven applications such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)."

T1055 – Process Injection  \n   Reason: “WARPWIRE … can embed itself into legitimate files on compromised Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs.” Embedding malicious JavaScript into a legitimate host process is consistent with injecting code into another process.\n\n2. T1056 – Input Capture  \n   Reason: “WARPWIRE can intercept credentials submitted during the web logon process …” Intercepting user-supplied credentials at the point of entry is classic input capture.\n\n3. T1005 – Data from Local System  \n   Reason: The malware “targets plaintext usernames and passwords” that reside on the VPN appliance; harvesting locally stored credentials maps to collection from the local system.\n\n4. T1029 – Scheduled Transfer  \n   Reason: The text implies credentials are exfiltrated repeatedly or on a schedule (“before transmitting them to its command and control (C2) server”), which aligns with scheduled/periodic transfer.\n\n5. T1041 – Exfiltration Over C2 Channel  \n   Reason: Stolen credentials are “sent via HTTP GET or POST requests” to the C2 server, i.e., exfiltration over the same channel used for command and control.\n\n6. T1132 – Data Encoding  \n   Reason: “It Base64 encodes captured credentials using `btoa()` …” Base64 encoding is a form of data encoding to obfuscate or prepare data for transmission.\n\n7. T1071.001 – Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols (sub-technique)  \n   Reason: Exfiltration uses HTTP GET/POST, which are web protocols at the application layer. While the parent technique T1071 is valid, the sub-technique is more specific; we will list only the parent ID per instructions.\n\n8. T1552 – Unsecured Credentials  \n   Reason: The malware specifically looks for “plaintext usernames and passwords,” i.e., credentials stored in an unsecured manner.\n\n9. T1589 – Gather Victim Identity Information  \n   Reason: Harvesting usernames and passwords is a direct means of gathering identity information about the victim users.\n\n10. T1590 – Gather Victim Network Information  \n    Reason: By compromising VPN appliances and stealing VPN credentials, the adversary learns about the victim’s network topology and access paths.\n\n11. T1021.001 – Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol (sub-technique)  \n    Reason: The text notes the stolen credentials enable “access to layer seven applications such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).” Again, we will list only the parent ID T1021.\n\n12. T1078 – Valid Accounts  \n    Reason: Once credentials are stolen, the adversary uses them as valid accounts to access internal resources.\n\nFinal list of main technique IDs (no sub-techniques):\n\nT1055,T1056,T1005,T1029,T1041,T1132,T1071,T1552,T1589,T1590,T1021,T1078",

T1055 – Process Injection  \n   Reason: “WARPWIRE … can embed itself into legitimate files on compromised Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs.” Embedding malicious JavaScript into a legitimate host process is consistent with injecting code into another process.\n\n2. T1056 – Input Capture  \n   Reason: “WARPWIRE can intercept credentials submitted during the web logon process …” Intercepting user-supplied credentials at the point of entry is classic input capture.\n\n3. T1005 – Data from Local System  \n   Reason: The malware “targets plaintext usernames and passwords” that reside on the VPN appliance; harvesting locally stored credentials maps to collection from the local system.\n\n4. T1029 – Scheduled Transfer  \n   Reason: The text implies credentials are exfiltrated repeatedly or on a schedule (“before transmitting them to its command and control (C2) server”), which aligns with scheduled/periodic transfer.\n\n5. T1041 – Exfiltration Over C2 Channel  \n   Reason: Stolen credentials are “sent via HTTP GET or POST requests” to the C2 server, i.e., exfiltration over the same channel used for command and control.\n\n6. T1132 – Data Encoding  \n   Reason: “It Base64 encodes captured credentials using `btoa()` …” Base64 encoding is a form of data encoding to obfuscate or prepare data for transmission.\n\n7. T1071.001 – Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols (sub-technique)  \n   Reason: Exfiltration uses HTTP GET/POST, which are web protocols at the application layer. While the parent technique T1071 is valid, the sub-technique is more specific; we will list only the parent ID per instructions.\n\n8. T1552 – Unsecured Credentials  \n   Reason: The malware specifically looks for “plaintext usernames and passwords,” i.e., credentials stored in an unsecured manner.\n\n9. T1589 – Gather Victim Identity Information  \n   Reason: Harvesting usernames and passwords is a direct means of gathering identity information about the victim users.\n\n10. T1590 – Gather Victim Network Information  \n    Reason: By compromising VPN appliances and stealing VPN credentials, the adversary learns about the victim’s network topology and access paths.\n\n11. T1021.001 – Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol (sub-technique)  \n    Reason: The text notes the stolen credentials enable “access to layer seven applications such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).” Again, we will list only the parent ID T1021.\n\n12.

It is linked to the ViaSat KA-SAT communication outage that occurred during the early stages of the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. AcidRain conducts a comprehensive wipe of the target filesystem and connected storage devices by either overwriting data or using various IOCTL commands to erase it. The malware systematically iterates over device file identifiers on the target, opens the device files, and then either overwrites them or issues IOCTL commands to remove the data. AcidRain specifically targets files and directories in the Linux operating system associated with storage devices. After completing the wiping process, AcidRain reboots the compromised system.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1134 : Access

Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** AcidRain is an ELF binary designed to target modems and routers using MIPS architecture. It is linked to the ViaSat KA-SAT communication outage that occurred during the early stages of the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. AcidRain conducts a comprehensive wipe of the target filesystem and connected storage devices by either overwriting data or using various IOCTL commands to erase it. The malware systematically iterates over device file identifiers on the target, opens the device files, and then either overwrites them or issues IOCTL commands to remove the data. AcidRain specifically targets files and directories in the Linux operating system associated with storage devices. After completing the wiping process, AcidRain reboots the compromised system.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1134 : Access

Provide reasoning for each identification. Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** AcidRain is an ELF binary designed to target modems and routers using MIPS architecture. It is linked to the ViaSat KA-SAT communication outage that occurred during the early stages of the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. AcidRain conducts a comprehensive wipe of the target filesystem and connected storage devices by either overwriting data or using various IOCTL commands to erase it. The malware systematically iterates over device file identifiers on the target, opens the device files, and then either overwrites them or issues IOCTL commands to remove the data. AcidRain specifically targets files and directories in the Linux operating system associated with storage devices. After completing the wiping process, AcidRain reboots the compromised system.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1134 : Access

It is linked to the ViaSat KA-SAT communication outage that occurred during the early stages of the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. AcidRain conducts a comprehensive wipe of the target filesystem and connected storage devices by either overwriting data or using various IOCTL commands to erase it. The malware systematically iterates over device file identifiers on the target, opens the device files, and then either overwrites them or issues IOCTL commands to remove the data. AcidRain specifically targets files and directories in the Linux operating system associated with storage devices. After completing the wiping process, AcidRain reboots the compromised system.",

T1561 – Disk Wipe  \n   The malware’s sole purpose is to “conduct a comprehensive wipe of the target filesystem and connected storage devices by either overwriting data or using various IOCTL commands to erase it.” This is the exact behaviour described in MITRE’s “Disk Wipe” technique.\n\n2. T1495 – Firmware Corruption  \n   AcidRain is an ELF binary compiled for MIPS routers/modems. Over-writing or IOCTL-erasing device files on these embedded systems corrupts the firmware image stored in flash, matching the “Firmware Corruption” technique.\n\n3.

MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** LoFiSe has been used by ToddyCat since at least 2023 to identify and collect files of interest on targeted systems. LoFiSe is capable of collecting files into password-protected ZIP archives for exfiltration. It periodically gathers all files from the working directory every three hours, placing them into a password-protected archive for later extraction. The malware also targets specific files of interest on compromised systems, saving them in the `C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\` and `C:\\Windows\\Temp\\` folders for further evaluation and exfiltration. LoFiSe monitors the file system to identify files smaller than 6.4 MB with extensions such as .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx, .pdf, .rtf, .tif, .odt, .ods, .odp, .eml, and .msg.

T1119 – Automated Collection  \n   Reason: “It periodically gathers all files from the working directory every three hours … It also targets specific files of interest …” Automated, recurring collection of files based on predefined criteria maps to T1119.\n\n3. T1083 – File and Directory Discovery  \n   Reason: “LoFiSe monitors the file system to identify files smaller than 6.4 MB with extensions such as …” Actively enumerating and discovering files/directories on the host is T1083.\n\n4. T1074 – Data Staged  \n   Reason: “… saving them in the `C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\` and `C:\\Windows\\Temp\\` folders for further evaluation and exfiltration.” Storing collected data in a staging location prior to exfiltration is T1074.\n\n5. T1041 – Exfiltration Over C2 Channel  \n   Reason: The text states the archives are created “for exfiltration.” While the exact channel is not specified, the context implies the same tool/malware will later send the archives out, which is most commonly done over the malware’s command-and-control channel (T1041).\n\n6. T1574 – Hijack Execution Flow (specifically DLL Side-Loading)  \n   Reason: “It has been executed through DLL side-loading as a file named `DsNcDiag.dll`.” DLL side-loading is a sub-technique under T1574.\n\nOnly the main (parent) technique IDs are required in the final line.\n\nT1560,T1119,T1083,T1074,T1041,T1574"

Managed and sold by the Malteiro cybercriminal group, Mispadu primarily targets victims in Brazil and Mexico, with confirmed operations across Latin America and Europe. Mispadu establishes persistence by creating a link in the startup folder and adding an entry to the registry key `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`. It utilizes malicious Google Chrome extensions to steal financial data and monitors browser activity for online banking actions, often displaying full-screen overlays to block user access to legitimate sites or to prompt for additional data. The trojan can capture and replace Bitcoin wallet addresses in the clipboard on compromised hosts. Mispadu’s dropper uses VBS files to install and execute its payloads. Additionally, the malware steals credentials from mail clients using NirSoft MailPassView and from Google Chrome. Before execution, Mispadu decrypts its encrypted configuration files. Mispadu includes a copy of the OpenSSL library to encrypt its command and control (C2) traffic, and it sends collected financial data to its C2 server.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs**

Managed and sold by the Malteiro cybercriminal group, Mispadu primarily targets victims in Brazil and Mexico, with confirmed operations across Latin America and Europe. Mispadu establishes persistence by creating a link in the startup folder and adding an entry to the registry key `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`. It utilizes malicious Google Chrome extensions to steal financial data and monitors browser activity for online banking actions, often displaying full-screen overlays to block user access to legitimate sites or to prompt for additional data. The trojan can capture and replace Bitcoin wallet addresses in the clipboard on compromised hosts. Mispadu’s dropper uses VBS files to install and execute its payloads. Additionally, the malware steals credentials from mail clients using NirSoft MailPassView and from Google Chrome. Before execution, Mispadu decrypts its encrypted configuration files. Mispadu includes a copy of the OpenSSL library to encrypt its command and control (C2) traffic, and it sends collected financial data to its C2 server."

Provide reasoning for each identification. Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** Mispadu is a banking trojan written in Delphi, first observed in 2019, that operates under a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) model. Managed and sold by the Malteiro cybercriminal group, Mispadu primarily targets victims in Brazil and Mexico, with confirmed operations across Latin America and Europe. Mispadu establishes persistence by creating a link in the startup folder and adding an entry to the registry key `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`. It utilizes malicious Google Chrome extensions to steal financial data and monitors browser activity for online banking actions, often displaying full-screen overlays to block user access to legitimate sites or to prompt for additional data. The trojan can capture and replace Bitcoin wallet addresses in the clipboard on compromised hosts. Mispadu’s dropper uses VBS files to install and execute its payloads.

Managed and sold by the Malteiro cybercriminal group, Mispadu primarily targets victims in Brazil and Mexico, with confirmed operations across Latin America and Europe. Mispadu establishes persistence by creating a link in the startup folder and adding an entry to the registry key `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`. It utilizes malicious Google Chrome extensions to steal financial data and monitors browser activity for online banking actions, often displaying full-screen overlays to block user access to legitimate sites or to prompt for additional data. The trojan can capture and replace Bitcoin wallet addresses in the clipboard on compromised hosts. Mispadu’s dropper uses VBS files to install and execute its payloads. Additionally, the malware steals credentials from mail clients using NirSoft MailPassView and from Google Chrome. Before execution, Mispadu decrypts its encrypted configuration files. Mispadu includes a copy of the OpenSSL library to encrypt its command and control (C2) traffic, and it sends collected financial data to its C2 server.",

T1505.003 – Server Software Component: Web Shell  \n   WIREFIRE is explicitly described as “a web shell written in Python that exists as trojanized logic to the visits.py component of Ivanti Connect Secure VPN appliances.” This matches the MITRE definition of installing a web shell as a malicious server component.\n\n2. T1105 – Ingress Tool Transfer  \n   The text states WIREFIRE “was used … for downloading files” and “has the ability to download files to compromised devices,” which is the classic ingress-tool-transfer behavior.\n\n3.

T1105 – Ingress Tool Transfer  \n   The text states WIREFIRE “was used … for downloading files” and “has the ability to download files to compromised devices,” which is the classic ingress-tool-transfer behavior.\n\n3. T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter  \n   WIREFIRE “can execute arbitrary commands,” satisfying the technique for abuse of a command-and-scripting interpreter on the victim host.\n\n4. T1132 – Data Encoding  \n   “WIREFIRE can Base64 encode process output sent to C2” directly corresponds to encoding C2 traffic.\n\n5. T1140 – Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information  \n   “WIREFIRE can decode, decrypt, and decompress data received in C2 HTTP POST requests” maps to the de-obfuscation/decoding technique.\n\n6. T1573 – Encrypted Channel  \n   “WIREFIRE can AES encrypt process output sent from compromised devices to C2” shows use of an encrypted C2 channel.\n\n7. T1071.001 – Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols  \n   Communication occurs via “specific HTTP POST requests to /api/v1/cav/client/visits,” so the web-protocol sub-technique applies.\n\nMain technique IDs only (no sub-technique IDs):\n\nT1505,T1105,T1059,T1132,T1140,T1573,T1071"

LITTLELAMB.WOOLTEA can append malicious components to the tmp/tmpmnt/bin/samba_upgrade.tar archive inside the factory reset partition in attempt to persist post reset. LITTLELAMB.WOOLTEA can initialize itself as a daemon to run persistently in the background. LITTLELAMB.WOOLTEA can communicate over SSL using the private key from the Ivanti Connect Secure web server. LITTLELAMB.WOOLTEA can monitor for system upgrade events by checking for the presence of /tmp/data/root/dev. LITTLELAMB.WOOLTEA can function as a stand-alone backdoor communicating over the /tmp/clientsDownload.sock socket. LITTLELAMB.WOOLTEA has the ability to function as a SOCKS proxy. LITTLELAMB.WOOLTEA can check the type of Ivanti VPN device it is running on by executing first_run() to identify the first four bytes of the motherboard serial number.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise

FlixOnline requests access to the NotificationListenerService, which can allow it to manipulate a device's notifications. FlixOnline may use the BOOT_COMPLETED action to trigger further scripts on boot. FlixOnline can automatically send replies to a user’s incoming WhatsApp messages. FlixOnline can hide its application icon. FlixOnline requests overlay permissions, which can allow it to create fake Login screens for other apps.

Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Mobile IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** FlixOnline is an Android malware, first detected in early 2021, believed to target users of WhatsApp. FlixOnline primarily spreads via automatic replies to a device’s incoming WhatsApp messages. FlixOnline requests access to the NotificationListenerService, which can allow it to manipulate a device's notifications. FlixOnline may use the BOOT_COMPLETED action to trigger further scripts on boot. FlixOnline can automatically send replies to a user’s incoming WhatsApp messages. FlixOnline can hide its application icon. FlixOnline requests overlay permissions, which can allow it to create fake Login screens for other apps. FlixOnline can steal data from a user’s WhatsApp account(s).  **List of All MITRE Mobile technique IDs** ID    : Name T1626 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1517 : Access Notifications T1640 : Account Access Removal T1638 : Adversary-in-the-Middle T1437 : Application Layer Protocol T1661 : Application Versioning T1532 : Archive Collected Data T1429 : Audio Capture T1398 : Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts T1616 : Call Control T1414 : Clipboard Data T1623 : Command and Scripting Interpreter T1577 : Compromise Application Executable T1645 : Compromise Client Software Binary T1634 : Credentials from Password Store T1662 : Data Destruction T1471 : Data Encrypted for Impact T1533 : Data from Local System T1641 : Data Manipulation T1407 : Download New Code at Runtime T1456 : Drive-By Compromise T1637 : Dynamic Resolution T1521 : Encrypted Channel T1642 : Endpoint Denial of Service T1624 : Event Triggered Execution T1627 : Execution Guardrails T1639 : Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol T1646 : Exfiltration Over C2 Channel T1658 : Exploitation for Client Execution T1664 : Exploitation for Initial Access T1404 : Exploitation for Privilege Escalation T1428 : Exploitation of Remote Services T1420 : File and Directory Discovery T1541 : Foreground Persistence T1643 : Generate Traffic from Victim T1628 : Hide Artifacts T1625 : Hijack Execution Flow T1617 : Hooking T1629 : Impair Defenses T1630 : Indicator Removal on Host T1544 : Ingress Tool Transfer T1417 : Input Capture T1516 : Input Injection T1430 : Location Tracking T1461 : Lockscreen Bypass T1655 : Masquerading T1575 : Native API T1464 : Network Denial of Service T1423 : Network Service Scanning T1509 : Non-Standard Port T1406 : Obfuscated Files or Information T1644 : Out of Band Data T1660 : Phishing T1424 : Process Discovery T1631 : Process Injection T1636 : Protected User Data T1604 : Proxy Through Victim T1663 : Remote Access Software T1458 : Replication Through Removable Media T1603 : Scheduled Task/Job T1513 : Screen Capture T1582 : SMS Control T1418 : Software Discovery T1635 : Steal Application Access Token T1409 : Stored Application Data T1632 : Subvert Trust Controls T1474 : Supply Chain Compromise T1426 : System Information Discovery T1422 : System Network Configuration Discovery T1421 : System Network Connections Discovery T1512 : Video Capture T1633 : Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion T1481 : Web Service     ",

MITRE Mobile IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** FlixOnline is an Android malware, first detected in early 2021, believed to target users of WhatsApp. FlixOnline primarily spreads via automatic replies to a device’s incoming WhatsApp messages. FlixOnline requests access to the NotificationListenerService, which can allow it to manipulate a device's notifications.

        "4e2ec36a9187875d9147ad28af6e42fc": "Here is the step-by-step mapping of every relevant behavior described in the text to the corresponding MITRE Mobile technique ID, with reasoning for each.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Automatic replies to incoming WhatsApp messages**\n- **Technique ID**: `T1516` – *Input Injection*\n- **Reasoning**: The malware automatically sends replies to WhatsApp messages without user interaction. This is a form of injecting input (messages) into the app, which aligns with Input Injection.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Requests access to NotificationListenerService to manipulate notifications**\n- **Technique ID**: `T1517` – *Access Notifications*\n- **Reasoning**: NotificationListenerService is explicitly used to access and potentially manipulate notifications. This is a direct match.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Uses BOOT_COMPLETED action to trigger scripts on boot**\n- **Technique ID**: `T1398` – *Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts*\n- **Reasoning**: The BOOT_COMPLETED action is used to execute scripts or code at boot time, which is a classic behavior for this technique.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Automatically sends replies to WhatsApp messages**\n- **Technique ID**: `T1516` – *Input Injection*\n- **Reasoning**: Already covered above; this is a repeated behavior reinforcing the same technique.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Hides its application icon**\n- **Technique ID**: `T1628` – *Hide Artifacts*\n- **Reasoning**: Hiding the app icon is a form of hiding artifacts from the user, which is explicitly covered by this technique.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Requests overlay permissions to create fake login screens**\n- **Technique ID**: `T1655` – *Masquerading*\n- **Reasoning**: Overlay permissions are used to create fake UIs (e.g., login screens) that mimic legitimate apps. This is a form of masquerading.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Steals data from WhatsApp account(s)**\n- **Technique ID**: `T1636` – *Protected User Data*\n- **Reasoning**: WhatsApp data is considered protected user data. Stealing it directly maps to this technique.\n\n---\n\n### Final Output (Main Technique IDs Only, No Subtechniques):\n\nT1516,T1517,T1398,T1628,T1655,T1636"

ZIPLINE can use /bin/sh to create a reverse shell and execute commands. ZIPLINE can use AES-128-CBC to encrypt data for both upload and download. ZIPLINE can find and append specific files on Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs based upon received commands. ZIPLINE can add itself to the exclusion list for the Ivanti Connect Secure Integrity Checker Tool if the --exclude parameter is passed by the tar process. ZIPLINE can download files to be saved on the compromised system. ZIPLINE can communicate with C2 using a custom binary protocol. ZIPLINE can identify running processes and their names. ZIPLINE can create a proxy server on compromised hosts.

Samurai allows arbitrary C# code execution and is used with multiple modules for remote administration and lateral movement. Samurai can use a .NET HTTPListener class to receive and handle HTTP POST requests. Samurai can use a remote command module for execution via the Windows command line. Samurai can create a service at HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\SvcHost to trigger execution and maintain persistence. Samurai can base64 encode data sent in C2 communications prior to its encryption. Samurai can leverage an exfiltration module to download arbitrary files from compromised machines. Samurai can encrypt C2 communications with AES. Samurai can use a specific module for file enumeration. Samurai has been used to deploy other malware including Ninja. Samurai has created the directory %COMMONPROGRAMFILES%\\Microsoft Shared\\wmi\\ to contain DLLs for loading successive stages. The Samurai loader component can create multiple Registry keys to force the svchost.exe process to load the final backdoor. Samurai has the ability to call Windows APIs.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1134 : Access Token Manipulation T1531 : Account

Samurai allows arbitrary C# code execution and is used with multiple modules for remote administration and lateral movement. Samurai can use a .NET HTTPListener class to receive and handle HTTP POST requests. Samurai can use a remote command module for execution via the Windows command line. Samurai can create a service at HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\SvcHost to trigger execution and maintain persistence. Samurai can base64 encode data sent in C2 communications prior to its encryption. Samurai can leverage an exfiltration module to download arbitrary files from compromised machines. Samurai can encrypt C2 communications with AES. Samurai can use a specific module for file enumeration. Samurai has been used to deploy other malware including Ninja. Samurai has created the directory %COMMONPROGRAMFILES%\\Microsoft Shared\\wmi\\ to contain DLLs for loading successive stages. The Samurai loader component can create multiple Registry keys to force the svchost.exe process to load the final backdoor. Samurai has the ability to call Windows APIs.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1134 : Access Token Manipulation T1531 : Account

T1059.003 – Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell  \n   Reason: “Samurai can use a remote command module for execution via the Windows command line.”\n\n2. T1055 – Process Injection  \n   Reason: The loader forces svchost.exe to load the final back-door DLL, which is a form of process injection.\n\n3. T1547.001 – Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder  \n   Reason: Creating Registry keys under HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\SvcHost to make svchost.exe load the backdoor at boot is a classic Run-key persistence mechanism.\n\n4. T1106 – Native API  \n   Reason: “Samurai has the ability to call Windows APIs.”\n\n5. T1071.001 – Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols  \n   Reason: Samurai uses the .NET HTTPListener class to receive and handle HTTP POST requests for C2.\n\n6. T1132.001 – Data Encoding: Standard Encoding  \n   Reason: “Samurai can base64 encode data sent in C2 communications prior to its encryption.”\n\n7. T1573 – Encrypted Channel  \n   Reason: “Samurai can encrypt C2 communications with AES,” establishing an encrypted C2 channel.\n\n8. T1041 – Exfiltration Over C2 Channel  \n   Reason: The exfiltration module downloads arbitrary files from compromised machines over the same C2 channel used for command and control.\n\n9. T1083 – File and Directory Discovery  \n   Reason: Samurai uses “a specific module for file enumeration,” i.e., discovering files and directories.\n\n10. T1105 – Ingress Tool Transfer  \n    Reason: Samurai has been used to deploy additional malware (e.g., Ninja) onto compromised hosts.\n\n11. T1574.002 – Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading  \n    Reason: The loader creates directories and Registry keys so that svchost.exe loads attacker-supplied DLLs, a form of DLL side-loading/hijacking.\n\n12. T1112 – Modify Registry  \n    Reason: Samurai “can create multiple Registry keys to force the svchost.exe process to load the final backdoor.”\n\nT1059,T1055,T1547,T1106,T1071,T1132,T1573,T1041,T1083,T1105,T1574,T1112",

Akira examines files prior to encryption to determine if they meet requirements for encryption and can be encrypted by the ransomware. These checks are performed through native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW. Akira will delete system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands. Akira executes native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo. Akira can identify remote file shares for encryption. Akira verifies the deletion of volume shadow copies by checking for the existence of the process ID related to the process created to delete these items. Akira uses the GetSystemInfo Windows function to determine the number of processors on a victim machine.

MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** Akira ransomware, written in C++, is most prominently (but not exclusively) associated with the a ransomware-as-a-service entity Akira. Akira will execute PowerShell commands to delete system volume shadow copies. Akira executes from the Windows command line and can take various arguments for execution. Akira encrypts victim filesystems for financial extortion purposes. Akira examines files prior to encryption to determine if they meet requirements for encryption and can be encrypted by the ransomware. These checks are performed through native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW. Akira will delete system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands. Akira executes native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo. Akira can identify remote file shares for encryption. Akira verifies the deletion of volume shadow copies by checking for the existence of the process ID related to the process created to delete these items. Akira uses the GetSystemInfo Windows function to determine the number of processors on a victim machine. Akira will leverage COM objects accessed through WMI during execution to evade detection.   **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1134

Akira will execute PowerShell commands to delete system volume shadow copies. Akira executes from the Windows command line and can take various arguments for execution. Akira encrypts victim filesystems for financial extortion purposes. Akira examines files prior to encryption to determine if they meet requirements for encryption and can be encrypted by the ransomware. These checks are performed through native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW. Akira will delete system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands. Akira executes native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo. Akira can identify remote file shares for encryption. Akira verifies the deletion of volume shadow copies by checking for the existence of the process ID related to the process created to delete these items. Akira uses the GetSystemInfo Windows function to determine the number of processors on a victim machine. Akira will leverage COM objects accessed through WMI during execution to evade detection.",

NKAbuse is initially installed and executed through an initial shell script. NKAbuse enables multiple types of network denial of service capabilities across several protocols post-installation. NKAbuse will check victim systems to ensure only one copy of the malware is running. NKAbuse has abused the NKN public blockchain protocol for its C2 communications. NKAbuse uses a Cron job to establish persistence when infecting Linux hosts. NKAbuse can take screenshots of the victim machine. NKAbuse conducts multiple system checks and includes these in subsequent \"heartbeat\" messages to the malware's command and control server.

MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** NKAbuse is a Go-based, multi-platform malware abusing NKN (New Kind of Network) technology for data exchange between peers, functioning as a potent implant, and equipped with both flooder and backdoor capabilities. NKAbuse is initially installed and executed through an initial shell script. NKAbuse enables multiple types of network denial of service capabilities across several protocols post-installation. NKAbuse will check victim systems to ensure only one copy of the malware is running. NKAbuse has abused the NKN public blockchain protocol for its C2 communications. NKAbuse uses a Cron job to establish persistence when infecting Linux hosts. NKAbuse can take screenshots of the victim machine. NKAbuse conducts multiple system checks and includes these in subsequent \"heartbeat\" messages to the malware's command and control server. NKAbuse utilizes external services such as ifconfig.me to identify the victim machine's IP address.[2]  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control

NKAbuse is initially installed and executed through an initial shell script. NKAbuse enables multiple types of network denial of service capabilities across several protocols post-installation. NKAbuse will check victim systems to ensure only one copy of the malware is running. NKAbuse has abused the NKN public blockchain protocol for its C2 communications. NKAbuse uses a Cron job to establish persistence when infecting Linux hosts. NKAbuse can take screenshots of the victim machine. NKAbuse conducts multiple system checks and includes these in subsequent \"heartbeat\" messages to the malware's command and control server. NKAbuse utilizes external services such as ifconfig.me to identify the victim machine's IP address.[2]",

SLOWPULSE is applied in compromised environments through modifications to legitimate Pulse Secure files. SLOWPULSE can write logged ACE credentials to /home/perl/PAUS.pm in append mode, using the format string %s:%s\\n. SLOWPULSE can modify LDAP and two factor authentication flows by inspecting login credentials and forcing successful authentication if the provided password matches a chosen backdoor password. SLOWPULSE can insert malicious logic to bypass RADIUS and ACE two factor authentication (2FA) flows if a designated attacker-supplied password is provided. SLOWPULSE can log credentials on compromised Pulse Secure VPNs during the DSAuth::AceAuthServer::checkUsernamePasswordACE-2FA authentication procedure.

RAPIDPULSE retrieves files from the victim system via encrypted commands sent to the web shell. RAPIDPULSE listens for specific HTTP query parameters in received communications. If specific parameters match, a hard-coded RC4 key is used to decrypt the HTTP query paremter hmacTime. This decrypts to a filename that is then open, read, encrypted with the same RC4 key, base64-encoded, written to standard out, then passed as a response to the HTTP request. RAPIDPULSE has the ability to RC4 encrypt and base64 encode decrypted files on compromised servers prior to writing them to stdout. RAPIDPULSE is a web shell that is capable of arbitrary file read on targeted web servers to exfiltrate items of interest on the victim device.[1]  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID

RAPIDPULSE retrieves files from the victim system via encrypted commands sent to the web shell. RAPIDPULSE listens for specific HTTP query parameters in received communications. If specific parameters match, a hard-coded RC4 key is used to decrypt the HTTP query paremter hmacTime. This decrypts to a filename that is then open, read, encrypted with the same RC4 key, base64-encoded, written to standard out, then passed as a response to the HTTP request. RAPIDPULSE has the ability to RC4 encrypt and base64 encode decrypted files on compromised servers prior to writing them to stdout.

T1505 – Server Software Component  \n   Reasoning: RAPIDPULSE is explicitly described as “a web shell that exists as a modification to a legitimate Pulse Secure file,” i.e., a malicious component added to existing server software.\n\n2. T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter  \n   Reasoning: Web shells typically accept and execute commands or scripts sent by the attacker; the text notes the shell “retrieves files … via encrypted commands,” indicating command/script execution.\n\n3. T1071 – Application Layer Protocol  \n   Reasoning: The shell “listens for specific HTTP query parameters” and responds over HTTP, using an application-layer protocol for C2.\n\n4. T1027 – Obfuscated Files or Information  \n   Reasoning: Data is “RC4-encrypted” and “base64-encoded” before exfiltration, clearly obfuscating the content.\n\n5. T1041 – Exfiltration Over C2 Channel  \n   Reasoning: The encrypted file content is “written to standard out, then passed as a response to the HTTP request,” i.e., exfiltrated back over the same C2 channel.\n\n6. T1005 – Data from Local System  \n   Reasoning: The shell “has the ability … to exfiltrate items of interest on the victim device,” i.e., collect data from the local system.\n\nFinal technique IDs (main techniques only, no sub-techniques):\n\nT1505,T1059,T1071,T1027,T1041,T1005",

This aligns with the MITRE technique T1219, which covers software used to remotely control systems.\n\n2. **Command and Control (C2) Communication via HTTP**  \n   - **Technique**: Application Layer Protocol (T1071)  \n   - **Reasoning**: The text states that 3PARA RAT communicates with C2 servers via HTTP. HTTP is an application layer protocol, making T1071 the correct mapping.\n\n3. **Encrypted Commands Using DES Algorithm**  \n   - **Technique**: Data Encoding (T1132)  \n   - **Reasoning**: The commands are encrypted using DES in CBC mode, which is a form of data encoding to obfuscate the content of the commands. T1132 covers encoding data for C2 communications.\n\n4. **Fallback Decryption Using XOR Key**  \n   - **Technique**: Data Encoding (T1132)  \n   - **Reasoning**: If DES decryption fails, the tool falls back to an 8-byte XOR key for decoding. This is another instance of data encoding, reinforcing T1132.\n\n5. **File Metadata Retrieval and Directory Listing**  \n   - **Technique**: File and Directory Discovery (T1083)  \n   - **Reasoning**: The tool includes commands to retrieve file metadata and list the current working directory, which are actions associated with discovering files and directories (T1083).\n\n6. **Modification of File Attributes (Timestamps)**  \n   - **Technique**: Indicator Removal (T1070)  \n   - **Reasoning**: Modifying file creation and modification timestamps is a method to remove indicators of compromise, aligning with T1070.\n\n### Final Output (Main Technique IDs Only)\nT1219,T1071,T1132,T1083,T1070"

            "raw_output": "Here is the mapping of every relevant MITRE Mobile ATT&CK technique mentioned (or strongly implied) in the text, together with the reasoning for each identification.\n\n1. T1664 – Exploitation for Initial Access  \n   Reasoning: The malware was “found in 19 Android applications” on Google Play and third-party stores. This indicates the adversary compromised legitimate applications (supply-chain style) and used them as the delivery vehicle for initial access.\n\n2. T1404 – Exploitation for Privilege Escalation  \n   Reasoning: “At least 7 [apps] exploiting known Android vulnerabilities to gain root permissions.” Using OS-level exploits to obtain root clearly maps to privilege-escalation via exploitation.\n\n3. T1626 – Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism  \n   Reasoning: After gaining root, the malware “can modify system settings to grant itself device administrator privileges.” Abusing Android’s device-admin APIs to elevate or maintain elevated access fits this technique.\n\n4. T1517 – Access Notifications  \n   Reasoning: The malware explicitly “monitor[s] notifications,” which is the definition of this technique.\n\n5. T1437 – Application Layer Protocol  \n   Reasoning: It “communicate[s] with its command and control (C2) server via HTTP,” an application-layer protocol.\n\n6. T1429 – Audio Capture  \n   Reasoning: The malware “can grant itself microphone … permissions,” enabling audio capture.\n\n7. T1512 – Video Capture  \n   Reasoning: Likewise, it grants itself “camera permissions,” enabling video capture.\n\n8. T1430 – Location Tracking  \n   Reasoning: It “access[es] location data,” which is location tracking.\n\n9. T1629 – Impair Defenses  \n   Reasoning: It “disable[s] Play Protect,” a clear defense-impairment action.\n\n10. T1426 – System Information Discovery  \n    Reasoning: It “collect[s] extensive device information, including the manufacturer, model, version, serial number, telephone number, IP address, and SIM information.”\n\n11. T1418 – Software Discovery  \n    Reasoning: It “obtain[s] a list of installed applications,” which is software discovery.\n\n12. T1407 – Download New Code at Runtime  \n    Reasoning: It “can download and install additional malware post-infection,” i.e., dynamically fetch and execute new code.\n\n13. T1582 – SMS Control  \n    Reasoning: It “intercept[s] SMS messages containing two-factor authentication codes,” which is SMS interception/control.\n\n14. T1616 – Call Control  \n    Reasoning: It “access[es] call logs,” part of call-oriented information gathering/control.\n\n15. T1406 – Obfuscated Files or Information  \n    Reasoning: It “uses encoded shell scripts and exploit binaries” and employs “code abstraction” to hide its payloads.\n\n16. T1633 – Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion  \n    Reasoning: It performs “anti-emulation checks” to avoid dynamic analysis environments.\n\nFinal line (main technique IDs only, no sub-techniques):\n\nT1664,T1404,T1626,T1517,T1437,T1429,T1512,T1430,T1629,T1426,T1418,T1407,T1582,T1616,T1406,T1633"

T1624 – Event Triggered Execution**\n- **Reasoning**: The adware registers to receive the `BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast intent, which triggers its execution upon device startup. This aligns with the technique of executing code in response to system events.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. T1437 – Application Layer Protocol**\n- **Reasoning**: The adware communicates with its C2 server via HTTP, which is an application-layer protocol. This matches the technique of using standard protocols for C2 communication.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. T1407 – Download New Code at Runtime**\n- **Reasoning**: The adware can receive instructions from the C2 server (e.g., to hide its icon or create a shortcut), implying it dynamically fetches new code or configurations at runtime.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. T1628 – Hide Artifacts**\n- **Reasoning**: The adware hides its icon, creates deceptive shortcuts, and mimics Facebook/Google icons to evade detection. This is a form of hiding its presence and artifacts on the device.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. T1655 – Masquerading**\n- **Reasoning**: The adware uses a `com.google.xxx` package name and mimics legitimate app icons (Facebook, Google) to appear trustworthy. This is a classic masquerading technique.\n\n---\n\n#### **6. T1406 – Obfuscated Files or Information**\n- **Reasoning**: The C2 server address is concealed using base-64 encoding, which is a form of obfuscation to hide critical information.\n\n---\n\n#### **7. T1426 – System Information Discovery**\n- **Reasoning**: The adware collects extensive device information (OS version, root status, battery, storage, etc.), which falls under system information discovery.\n\n---\n\n#### **8. T1633 – Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion**\n- **Reasoning**: The adware checks if the device’s IP is within known Google IP ranges (likely to avoid detection in emulators or sandboxes) and delays payload deployment to evade analysis. This aligns with sandbox evasion techniques.\n\n---\n\n#### **9. T1544 – Ingress Tool Transfer**\n- **Reasoning**: While not explicitly stated, the adware’s ability to receive instructions or payloads from the C2 server implies it may transfer additional tools or code to the device.\n\n---\n\n### Final Output (Main Technique IDs Only)\nT1624,T1437,T1407,T1628,T1655,T1406,T1426,T1633,T1544"

This implies exploitation of vulnerabilities in IIS to gain initial access, which maps to **T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application**.\n\n3. **Tool Transfer (ASPXTool Variant)**  \n   - The modified variant (ASPXTool) is transferred to the target server, which falls under **T1105: Ingress Tool Transfer**, as adversaries often transfer tools or payloads to compromised systems.\n\n4. **Threat Group Activity (TG-3390)**  \n   - While the text mentions a threat group, this is contextual and does not directly map to a specific technique.

            "raw_output": "Here is a step-by-step mapping of every MITRE Enterprise technique that can be inferred from the text, together with the reasoning for each identification.\n\n1. T1548 – Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism  \n   Reason: “DarkGate employs two distinct User Account Control (UAC) bypass techniques to escalate privileges.”\n\n2. T1134 – Access Token Manipulation  \n   Reason: “utilizes parent PID spoofing … to evade detection.” Parent PID spoofing is a form of manipulating access tokens (T1134).\n\n3. T1055 – Process Injection  \n   Reason: Parent PID spoofing is often paired with process injection to run code inside a chosen parent process, matching the description of “rootkit-like” features.\n\n4. T1562 – Impair Defenses  \n   Reason: The malware’s “rootkit-like” features (e.g., hiding from Task Manager/Process Explorer) are designed to impair or evade security tools.\n\n5. T1136 – Create Account  \n   Reason: “the malware elevates accounts it creates to the local administrator group.”\n\n6. T1098 – Account Manipulation  \n   Reason: After creating accounts, DarkGate adds them to the local administrators group—an explicit manipulation of account permissions.\n\n7. T1071 – Application Layer Protocol  \n   Reason: C2 traffic is disguised within DNS records, indicating use of standard application-layer protocols (DNS) for command and control.\n\n8. T1568 – Dynamic Resolution  \n   Reason: The use of “hard-coded domains” that mimic legitimate CDNs implies dynamic resolution techniques to locate C2 infrastructure.\n\n9. T1102 – Web Service  \n   Reason: C2 domains are crafted to “mimic legitimate services like Akamai CDN or Amazon Web Services,” leveraging web services for command and control.\n\n10. T1005 – Data from Local System  \n    Reason: DarkGate “search[es] for cryptocurrency wallets by scanning application window names” and extracts data from the hosting process’s memory—collecting data stored on the local system.\n\n11. T1010 – Application Window Discovery  \n    Reason: It “scan[s] application window names for specific strings” to locate cryptocurrency wallets, which is application-window discovery.\n\n12. T1555 – Credentials from Password Stores  \n    Reason: It uses NirSoft tools to extract stored credentials (password stores) related to cryptocurrency wallets.\n\n13. T1105 – Ingress Tool Transfer  \n    Reason: The malware must first transfer NirSoft tools (or similar utilities) onto the victim host before using them.\n\n14. T1041 – Exfiltration Over C2 Channel  \n    Reason: “When stored credentials … are identified, DarkGate alerts its C2 server,” indicating exfiltration of the discovered data over the same C2 channel.\n\n15. T1657 – Financial Theft  \n    Reason: The entire workflow of locating and exfiltrating cryptocurrency wallet credentials is aimed at financial theft.\n\nFinal line (only main technique IDs, no sub-techniques):\n\nT1548,T1134,T1055,T1562,T1136,T1098,T1071,T1568,T1102,T1005,T1010,T1555,T1105,T1041,T1657"

T1071 – Application Layer Protocol  \n   Reasoning: The backdoor “beacons to the NKN network via an HTTP POST request.” HTTP is an application-layer protocol, so this activity falls under T1071.\n\n2. T1573 – Encrypted Channel  \n   Reasoning: NGLite “uses an AES-encrypted channel for C2 communication,” which is exactly the behavior described by T1573.\n\n3. T1102 – Web Service  \n   Reasoning: The malware leverages the legitimate NKN (New Kind of Network) infrastructure—a decentralized web-like service—for its C2. Abusing such a public web service maps to T1102.\n\n4. T1082 – System Information Discovery  \n   Reasoning: NGLite “executes the ‘whoami’ command to collect system information and transmit it back to the C2 server,” which is classic system-information discovery.\n\n5. T1033 – System Owner/User Discovery  \n   Reasoning: Running “whoami” also reveals the current user context, satisfying T1033.\n\n6. T1016 – System Network Configuration Discovery  \n   Reasoning: The malware “identifies the victim system’s … IPv4 address,” which is part of enumerating the local network configuration.\n\n7. T1124 – System Time Discovery (implied)  \n   Reasoning: While not explicitly stated, beaconing malware almost always checks the local system time to embed in messages or to schedule tasks; this is a common companion to other discovery techniques.\n\n8. T1571 – Non-Standard Port  \n   Reasoning: The initial beacon is sent “over TCP port 30003,” which is not a standard HTTP(S) port (80/443), matching T1571.\n\n9. T1041 – Exfiltration Over C2 Channel  \n   Reasoning: After collecting system information, NGLite “transmit[s] it back to the C2 server” using the same channel, which is exfiltration over the C2 channel.\n\n10. T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter  \n    Reasoning: The backdoor “execute[s] commands received through its command and control (C2) channel,” implying use of a local command interpreter (cmd, PowerShell, sh, etc.).\n\n11. T1105 – Ingress Tool Transfer  \n    Reasoning: Although not detailed, a backdoor that can execute arbitrary commands is typically used to download and run additional tools, which is T1105.\n\nIDs for the main techniques (no sub-techniques):  \nT1071,T1573,T1102,T1082,T1033,T1016,T1124,T1571,T1041,T1059,T1105"

This aligns with exploiting a public-facing application to gain initial access.\n\n#### 2. **Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware (COATHANGER) is transferred to the target system after exploitation, which is a classic example of transferring tools into the environment.\n\n#### 3. **Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware provides a BusyBox reverse shell, which is a command-line interface for executing commands. This falls under the use of a command and scripting interpreter.\n\n#### 4. **Application Layer Protocol (T1071)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware uses HTTP GET requests and TLS tunnels for C2 communication, which are application-layer protocols (HTTP/HTTPS).\n\n#### 5. **Encrypted Channel (T1573)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware connects to C2 infrastructure using SSL/TLS, which is an encrypted channel for secure communication.\n\n#### 6. **Create or Modify System Process (T1543)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware creates a daemon for timed check-ins with the C2 infrastructure, which involves creating or modifying a system process.\n\n#### 7. **Hide Artifacts (T1564)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware installs itself into a hidden directory and replaces legitimate system functions (e.g., `read(2)`), which is a form of hiding artifacts.\n\n#### 8. **Masquerading (T1036)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware replaces legitimate shared objects (e.g., `read(2)`) with malicious ones, masquerading as legitimate system functions.\n\n#### 9. **Rootkit (T1014)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware replaces system functions like `read(2)` with malicious shared objects, which is characteristic of rootkit behavior (hooking or replacing system calls).\n\n#### 10. **System Information Discovery (T1082)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware surveys the contents of system files during installation, which is a form of system information discovery.\n\n#### 11. **Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027)**\n- **Reasoning**: The malware decodes configuration items from a bundled file, which implies obfuscation or encoding of data.\n\n---\n\n### Final Output (Main Technique IDs Only)\n1190,1105,1059,1071,1573,1543,1564,1036,1014,1082,1027"

T1055 – Process Injection  \n   Reason: “WARPWIRE … can embed itself into legitimate files on compromised Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs.” Embedding malicious JavaScript into a legitimate host process is consistent with injecting code into another process.\n\n2. T1056 – Input Capture  \n   Reason: “WARPWIRE can intercept credentials submitted during the web logon process …” Intercepting user-supplied credentials at the point of entry is classic input capture.\n\n3. T1005 – Data from Local System  \n   Reason: The malware “targets plaintext usernames and passwords” that reside on the VPN appliance; harvesting locally stored credentials maps to collection from the local system.\n\n4. T1029 – Scheduled Transfer  \n   Reason: The text implies credentials are exfiltrated repeatedly or on a schedule (“before transmitting them to its command and control (C2) server”), which aligns with scheduled/periodic transfer.\n\n5. T1041 – Exfiltration Over C2 Channel  \n   Reason: Stolen credentials are “sent via HTTP GET or POST requests” to the C2 server, i.e., exfiltration over the same channel used for command and control.\n\n6. T1132 – Data Encoding  \n   Reason: “It Base64 encodes captured credentials using `btoa()` …” Base64 encoding is a form of data encoding to obfuscate or prepare data for transmission.\n\n7. T1071.001 – Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols (sub-technique)  \n   Reason: Exfiltration uses HTTP GET/POST, which are web protocols at the application layer. While the parent technique T1071 is valid, the sub-technique is more specific; we will list only the parent ID per instructions.\n\n8. T1552 – Unsecured Credentials  \n   Reason: The malware specifically looks for “plaintext usernames and passwords,” i.e., credentials stored in an unsecured manner.\n\n9. T1589 – Gather Victim Identity Information  \n   Reason: Harvesting usernames and passwords is a direct means of gathering identity information about the victim users.\n\n10. T1590 – Gather Victim Network Information  \n    Reason: By compromising VPN appliances and stealing VPN credentials, the adversary learns about the victim’s network topology and access paths.\n\n11. T1021.001 – Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol (sub-technique)  \n    Reason: The text notes the stolen credentials enable “access to layer seven applications such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).” Again, we will list only the parent ID T1021.\n\n12.

T1074 – Data Staged  \n   Reason: “… saving them in the `C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\` and `C:\\Windows\\Temp\\` folders for further evaluation and exfiltration.” Storing collected data in a staging location prior to exfiltration is T1074.\n\n5. T1041 – Exfiltration Over C2 Channel  \n   Reason: The text states the archives are created “for exfiltration.” While the exact channel is not specified, the context implies the same tool/malware will later send the archives out, which is most commonly done over the malware’s command-and-control channel (T1041).\n\n6.

T1105 – Ingress Tool Transfer  \n   The text states WIREFIRE “was used … for downloading files” and “has the ability to download files to compromised devices,” which is the classic ingress-tool-transfer behavior.\n\n3. T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter  \n   WIREFIRE “can execute arbitrary commands,” satisfying the technique for abuse of a command-and-scripting interpreter on the victim host.\n\n4. T1132 – Data Encoding  \n   “WIREFIRE can Base64 encode process output sent to C2” directly corresponds to encoding C2 traffic.\n\n5. T1140 – Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information  \n   “WIREFIRE can decode, decrypt, and decompress data received in C2 HTTP POST requests” maps to the de-obfuscation/decoding technique.\n\n6. T1573 – Encrypted Channel  \n   “WIREFIRE can AES encrypt process output sent from compromised devices to C2” shows use of an encrypted C2 channel.\n\n7.

This is a form of injecting input (messages) into the app, which aligns with Input Injection.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Requests access to NotificationListenerService to manipulate notifications**\n- **Technique ID**: `T1517` – *Access Notifications*\n- **Reasoning**: NotificationListenerService is explicitly used to access and potentially manipulate notifications. This is a direct match.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Uses BOOT_COMPLETED action to trigger scripts on boot**\n- **Technique ID**: `T1398` – *Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts*\n- **Reasoning**: The BOOT_COMPLETED action is used to execute scripts or code at boot time, which is a classic behavior for this technique.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Automatically sends replies to WhatsApp messages**\n- **Technique ID**: `T1516` – *Input Injection*\n- **Reasoning**: Already covered above; this is a repeated behavior reinforcing the same technique.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Hides its application icon**\n- **Technique ID**: `T1628` – *Hide Artifacts*\n- **Reasoning**: Hiding the app icon is a form of hiding artifacts from the user, which is explicitly covered by this technique.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Requests overlay permissions to create fake login screens**\n- **Technique ID**: `T1655` – *Masquerading*\n- **Reasoning**: Overlay permissions are used to create fake UIs (e.g., login screens) that mimic legitimate apps. This is a form of masquerading.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Steals data from WhatsApp account(s)**\n- **Technique ID**: `T1636` – *Protected User Data*\n- **Reasoning**: WhatsApp data is considered protected user data.

T1059.003 – Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell  \n   Reason: “Samurai can use a remote command module for execution via the Windows command line.”\n\n2. T1055 – Process Injection  \n   Reason: The loader forces svchost.exe to load the final back-door DLL, which is a form of process injection.\n\n3. T1547.001 – Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder  \n   Reason: Creating Registry keys under HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\SvcHost to make svchost.exe load the backdoor at boot is a classic Run-key persistence mechanism.\n\n4. T1106 – Native API  \n   Reason: “Samurai has the ability to call Windows APIs.”\n\n5. T1071.001 – Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols  \n   Reason: Samurai uses the .NET HTTPListener class to receive and handle HTTP POST requests for C2.\n\n6. T1132.001 – Data Encoding: Standard Encoding  \n   Reason: “Samurai can base64 encode data sent in C2 communications prior to its encryption.”\n\n7. T1573 – Encrypted Channel  \n   Reason: “Samurai can encrypt C2 communications with AES,” establishing an encrypted C2 channel.\n\n8. T1041 – Exfiltration Over C2 Channel  \n   Reason: The exfiltration module downloads arbitrary files from compromised machines over the same C2 channel used for command and control.\n\n9. T1083 – File and Directory Discovery  \n   Reason: Samurai uses “a specific module for file enumeration,” i.e., discovering files and directories.\n\n10. T1105 – Ingress Tool Transfer  \n    Reason: Samurai has been used to deploy additional malware (e.g., Ninja) onto compromised hosts.\n\n11. T1574.002 – Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading  \n    Reason: The loader creates directories and Registry keys so that svchost.exe loads attacker-supplied DLLs, a form of DLL side-loading/hijacking.\n\n12. T1112 – Modify Registry  \n    Reason: Samurai “can create multiple Registry keys to force the svchost.exe process to load the final backdoor.”\n\nT1059,T1055,T1547,T1106,T1071,T1132,T1573,T1041,T1083,T1105,T1574,T1112"

T1132 – Data Encoding  \n   The shell “has hexadecimal and Base64 encoded C2 content,” indicating the adversary encodes command-and-control traffic.\n\n3. T1140 – Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information  \n   GLASSTOKEN “has the ability to decode hexadecimal and Base64 C2 requests,” showing it reverses the encoding it (or the attacker) applies.\n\n4. T1572 – Protocol Tunneling  \n   The shell is “capable of tunneling C2 connections,” which matches tunneling traffic inside another protocol.\n\n5. T1505.003 – Web Shell (sub-technique)  \n   The very first sentence labels GLASSTOKEN as “a custom web shell,” so the parent technique is Server Software Component.\n\nMain technique IDs only (no sub-technique IDs):\n\nT1059,T1132,T1140,T1572,T1505"
