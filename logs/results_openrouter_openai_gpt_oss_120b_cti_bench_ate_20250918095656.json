Includes commands to retrieve file metadata, list current working directory, modify file attributes (creation/modification timestamps).\n\nWe need to map to MITRE techniques.\n\nPotential techniques:\n\n- T1071: Application Layer Protocol (communicates via HTTP). Yes.\n\n- T1027: Obfuscated Files or Information (encryption, XOR, DES). Also Data Encoding? Actually encryption for C2 commands is obfuscation. So T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information) fits.\n\n- T1140: Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information? That's for decoding. But the technique is about deobfuscating. The RAT encrypts commands; the attacker decodes. Might be T1140 (Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information). However T1027 covers obfuscation. We'll choose T1027.\n\n- T1083: File and Directory Discovery (retrieve file metadata, list cwd). Yes.\n\n- T1222: File and Directory Permissions Modification? Actually modify file attributes timestamps. That's more like T1099? Wait there is technique \"Modify Existing Files\" maybe T1565 Data Manipulation?

Then final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs.\n\nThe text describes 3PARA RAT: remote access tool, communicates via HTTP (application layer protocol), commands encrypted using DES CBC, key derived from MD5 hash, fallback to XOR decode. Includes commands to retrieve file metadata, list current working directory, modify file attributes (creation/modification timestamps).\n\nWe need to map to MITRE techniques.\n\nPotential techniques:\n\n- T1071: Application Layer Protocol (communicates via HTTP). Yes.\n\n- T1027: Obfuscated Files or Information (encryption, XOR, DES). Also Data Encoding? Actually encryption for C2 commands is obfuscation. So T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information) fits.\n\n- T1140: Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information? That's for decoding. But the technique is about deobfuscating. The RAT encrypts commands; the attacker decodes. Might be T1140 (Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information). However T1027 covers obfuscation. We'll choose T1027.\n\n- T1083: File and Directory Discovery (retrieve file metadata, list cwd). Yes.\n\n- T1222: File and Directory Permissions Modification? Actually modify file attributes timestamps. That's more like T1099? Wait there is technique \"Modify Existing Files\" maybe T1565 Data Manipulation? But file attribute timestamps modification is \"Modify Registry\"? Not. There's technique \"Modify Existing Files\" not in list. There's \"Modify File Attributes\" maybe T1222?

Then final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs.\n\nThe text describes 3PARA RAT: remote access tool, communicates via HTTP (application layer protocol), commands encrypted using DES CBC, key derived from MD5 hash, fallback to XOR decode. Includes commands to retrieve file metadata, list current working directory, modify file attributes (creation/modification timestamps).\n\nWe need to map to MITRE techniques.\n\nPotential techniques:\n\n- T1071: Application Layer Protocol (communicates via HTTP). Yes.\n\n- T1027: Obfuscated Files or Information (encryption, XOR, DES). Also Data Encoding? Actually encryption for C2 commands is obfuscation. So T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information) fits.\n\n- T1140: Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information? That's for decoding. But the technique is about deobfuscating. The RAT encrypts commands; the attacker decodes. Might be T1140 (Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information). However T1027 covers obfuscation. We'll choose T1027.\n\n- T1083: File and Directory Discovery (retrieve file metadata, list cwd). Yes.\n\n- T1222: File and Directory Permissions Modification? Actually modify file attributes timestamps. That's more like T1099? Wait there is technique \"Modify Existing Files\" maybe T1565 Data Manipulation? But file attribute timestamps modification is \"Modify Registry\"? Not. There's technique \"Modify Existing Files\" not in list. There's \"Modify File Attributes\" maybe T1222? Actually T1222 is \"File and Directory Permissions Modification\". Not timestamps. There's \"Modify Existing Files\" not in list. Could be \"Modify Registry\" no. There's \"Modify System Image\". Not. There's \"Modify Authentication Process\". Not.\n\nBut there is technique \"Modify File Attributes\" maybe part of \"Modify Existing Files\" which is T1565.001? Data Manipulation subtechnique. However we only have main technique IDs, not subtechniques. T1565 is Data Manipulation. That could cover modifying timestamps. So we can map to T1565.\n\n- T1219: Remote Access Software (RAT). That's a technique for remote access tools. Actually MITRE has T1219 \"Remote Access Software\". Yes.\n\n- T1105: Ingress Tool Transfer? Not described. No.\n\n- T1078: Valid Accounts? Not.\n\n- T1041: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel? Not.\n\n- T1090: Proxy? Not.\n\n- T1005: Data from Local System? Not.\n\n- T1082: System Information Discovery? Not.\n\n- T1112: Modify Registry? Not.\n\n- T1560: Archive Collected Data? Not.\n\n- T1070: Indicator Removal? Not.\n\n- T1562: Impair Defenses? Not.\n\n- T1036: Masquerading? Not.\n\n- T1047: Windows Management Instrumentation? Not.\n\n- T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter? Not.\n\n- T1102: Web Service? Not.\n\n- T1071 is definitely.\n\n- T1027 is definitely.\n\n- T1083 is definitely.\n\n- T1219 is definitely.\n\n- T1565 maybe.\n\nAlso \"commands encrypted using DES algorithm in CBC mode\" could be \"Encrypt Data\" but that's for impact. There's T1486 Data Encrypted for Impact. But here encryption is for C2, not impact. So not.\n\nAlso \"MD5 hash\" maybe \"Obfuscated Files or Information\".\n\nThus main techniques: T1071, T1027, T1083, T1219, T1565.\n\nCheck if any other: \"modify file attributes, such as creation and modification timestamps\" could be \"Modify Existing Files\" which is T1565 (Data Manipulation). So okay.\n\nNow we need to provide reasoning for each identification.\n\nFinally final line: IDs separated by commas, only main technique IDs, no subtechnique IDs. So \"T1071,T1027,T1083,T1219,T1565\". Ensure order maybe as identified.\n\nNow produce answer.",

Also \"command line to execute Portable Executables (PEs)\" -> Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059) maybe also \"Execution\" but not in list. \"Decrypting AES-encrypted payloads\" -> Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information (T1140) or Data Encoding? Actually decrypting payloads is deobfuscate/decode. So T1140.\n\n- \"extract malicious PEs from images\" -> \"Steganography\"? Not in list. Could be \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) maybe. But extracting from images is \"Steganography\" which is not listed. Could map to \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) as it's a method to hide payloads.\n\n- \"inject shellcode into svchost.exe\" -> Process Injection (T1055).\n\n- \"detect the installed anti-virus software\" -> \"Security Software Discovery\"? Not in list. Could be \"Query Registry\" (T1012) or \"System Information Discovery\" (T1082) but specifically anti-virus detection is \"Security Software Discovery\" which is T1518? Actually T1518 is Software Discovery. There's also T1518.001 \"Security Software Discovery\". So main technique is Software Discovery (T1518). Use that.\n\n- \"command line to execute Portable Executables\" also could be \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) or \"Native API\" (T1106) but likely T1059.\n\n- \"download files from C2 server\" also \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1105) or \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\"? No.\n\n- \"communicates via HTTP\" also \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) and maybe \"Web Service\" (T1102) but HTTP is generic.\n\nThus list of techniques: T1071, T1105, T1059, T1140, T1027, T1055, T1518.\n\nCheck if any other: \"detect installed anti-virus software\" could also be \"Query Registry\" (T1012) but detection may involve checking processes, but we have Software Discovery.\n\nThus final line IDs: T1071, T1105, T1059, T1140, T1027, T1055, T1518\n\nNow produce answer with reasoning for each.",

MITRE Mobile IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** AbstractEmu is mobile malware that was first detected in October 2021 on Google Play and other third-party app stores. It was found in 19 Android applications, with at least 7 exploiting known Android vulnerabilities to gain root permissions. While primarily affecting users in the United States, AbstractEmu’s reach extends to victims across 17 countries. The malware can modify system settings to grant itself device administrator privileges, monitor notifications, and communicate with its command and control (C2) server via HTTP. AbstractEmu can also grant itself microphone and camera permissions, access location data, and disable Play Protect. Additionally, it can collect extensive device information, including the manufacturer, model, version, serial number, telephone number, IP address, and SIM information. AbstractEmu can download and install additional malware post-infection, access call logs, intercept SMS messages containing two-factor authentication codes, and obtain a list of installed applications. The malware uses encoded shell scripts and exploit binaries to facilitate the rooting process and can silently gain permissions or install additional malware using rooting exploits. To evade detection, AbstractEmu employs code abstraction and anti-emulation checks.  **List of All MITRE Mobile technique IDs** ID    : Name T1626 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1517 : Access Notifications T1640 : Account Access Removal T1638 : Adversary-in-the-Middle T1437 : Application Layer Protocol T1661 : Application Versioning T1532 : Archive Collected Data T1429 : Audio Capture T1398 : Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts T1616 : Call Control T1414 : Clipboard Data T1623 : Command and Scripting Interpreter T1577 : Compromise Application Executable T1645 : Compromise Client Software Binary T1634 : Credentials from Password Store T1662 : Data Destruction T1471 : Data Encrypted for Impact T1533 : Data from Local System T1641 : Data Manipulation T1407 : Download New Code at Runtime T1456 : Drive-By Compromise T1637 : Dynamic Resolution T1521 : Encrypted Channel T1642 : Endpoint Denial of Service T1624 : Event Triggered Execution T1627 : Execution Guardrails T1639 : Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol T1646 : Exfiltration Over C2 Channel T1658 : Exploitation for Client Execution T1664 : Exploitation for Initial Access T1404 : Exploitation for Privilege Escalation T1428 : Exploitation of Remote Services T1420 : File and Directory Discovery T1541 : Foreground Persistence T1643 : Generate Traffic from Victim T1628 : Hide Artifacts T1625 : Hijack Execution Flow T1617 : Hooking T1629 : Impair Defenses T1630 : Indicator Removal on Host T1544 : Ingress Tool Transfer T1417 : Input Capture T1516 : Input Injection T1430 : Location Tracking T1461 : Lockscreen Bypass T1655 : Masquerading T1575 : Native API T1464 : Network Denial of Service T1423 : Network Service Scanning T1509 : Non-Standard Port T1406 : Obfuscated Files or Information T1644 : Out of Band Data T1660 : Phishing T1424 : Process Discovery T1631 : Process Injection T1636 : Protected User Data T1604 : Proxy Through Victim T1663 : Remote Access Software T1458 : Replication Through Removable Media T1603 : Scheduled Task/Job T1513 : Screen Capture T1582 : SMS Control T1418 : Software Discovery T1635 : Steal Application Access Token T1409 : Stored Application Data T1632 : Subvert Trust Controls T1474 : Supply Chain Compromise T1426 : System Information Discovery T1422 : System Network Configuration Discovery T1421 : System Network Connections Discovery T1512 : Video Capture T1633 : Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion T1481 : Web Service     ",

Provide reasoning for each identification. Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Mobile IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** AbstractEmu is mobile malware that was first detected in October 2021 on Google Play and other third-party app stores. It was found in 19 Android applications, with at least 7 exploiting known Android vulnerabilities to gain root permissions. While primarily affecting users in the United States, AbstractEmu’s reach extends to victims across 17 countries. The malware can modify system settings to grant itself device administrator privileges, monitor notifications, and communicate with its command and control (C2) server via HTTP. AbstractEmu can also grant itself microphone and camera permissions, access location data, and disable Play Protect. Additionally, it can collect extensive device information, including the manufacturer, model, version, serial number, telephone number, IP address, and SIM information.

It was found in 19 Android applications, with at least 7 exploiting known Android vulnerabilities to gain root permissions. While primarily affecting users in the United States, AbstractEmu’s reach extends to victims across 17 countries. The malware can modify system settings to grant itself device administrator privileges, monitor notifications, and communicate with its command and control (C2) server via HTTP. AbstractEmu can also grant itself microphone and camera permissions, access location data, and disable Play Protect. Additionally, it can collect extensive device information, including the manufacturer, model, version, serial number, telephone number, IP address, and SIM information. AbstractEmu can download and install additional malware post-infection, access call logs, intercept SMS messages containing two-factor authentication codes, and obtain a list of installed applications.

The text describes Action RAT capabilities: remote access tool, communicates via HTTP, executes commands using cmd.exe, collects local data, drive and file info, uses Base64 decoding to process communications, can download additional payloads.\n\nWe need to identify techniques:\n\n- Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059) – using cmd.exe to execute commands.\n- Application Layer Protocol (T1071) – communicates via HTTP (application layer protocol).\n- Data from Local System (T1005) – collecting local data, drive and file info.\n- Data Encoding (T1132) – Base64 decoding (though Base64 is encoding; decoding is part of data encoding/obfuscation). Could be \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) or \"Data Encoding\" (T1132). The text says uses Base64 decoding to process communications. That's decoding, which is part of \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) or \"Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\" (T1140). T1140 is Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information. So we can map to T1140.\n- Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105) – download additional payloads onto infected systems.\n- Remote Services (T1021) – remote access tool? Actually remote access tool is used to control host; but remote services is about using remote services to gain access. Might be \"Remote Services\" (T1021) or \"Remote Access Software\" (T1219). The text says Action RAT is a remote access tool; that is a capability, not necessarily a technique. Could map to \"Remote Access Software\" (T1219) which is a technique for using remote access tools. So include T1219.\n- Possibly \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) but not mentioned.

Additionally, adbupd can achieve persistence by leveraging a WMI script.\"\n\nWe need to identify techniques:\n\n- Execute a copy of cmd.exe => Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059). Possibly also \"cmd.exe\" is Windows Command Shell subtechnique T1059.003 but we only list main technique ID T1059.\n\n- Includes OpenSSL library to encrypt its C2 traffic => Use of encrypted channel => \"Encrypted Channel\" (T1573) or \"Obfuscated Files or Information\"? Actually encrypt C2 traffic is \"Encrypted Channel\" T1573. Also could be \"Application Layer Protocol\" T1071? But encryption is specifically T157.\n\n- Persistence by leveraging a WMI script => Use of Windows Management Instrumentation for persistence. That's \"Windows Management Instrumentation\" T1047 (which is a technique for command and control, but also for execution). However MITRE has subtechnique T1047 is \"Windows Management Instrumentation\". That's a main technique ID T1047.\n\nAlso \"Backdoor\" is a type of malware but not a technique. \"Similarities to Dipsind\" not relevant.\n\nThus we have three techniques: T1059, T1573, T1047.\n\nCheck list includes T1047: Windows Management Instrumentation. Yes.\n\nAlso maybe \"Encrypt its command and control traffic\" could be \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" T1027 (encrypting data). But the description says encrypt C2 traffic, which is T1573. We'll include both? Provide reasoning for each. But we need to map all attack patterns present. Could also be \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" for cmd.exe. Also \"Persistence\" via WMI script could be \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" T1547? But specifically WMI script for persistence is T1047 (WMI) used for execution, but MITRE also has subtechnique T1546.003 \"Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription\". However main technique T1546 is Event Triggered Execution. But the text says \"persistence by leveraging a WMI script\".

Enumerating user and group objects in Active Directory is a classic example of **Account Discovery** (MITRE ID **T1087**).  \n- It also mentions the ability to “gather details about domain trusts”. Collecting information about trust relationships between AD domains maps to **Domain Trust Discovery** (MITRE ID **T1482**).  \n- Since the tool can list “domain groups”, this aligns with the technique **Permission Groups Discovery**, which focuses on identifying groups and their memberships (MITRE ID **T1069**).  \n\nThese three techniques capture the primary adversary behaviors described in the passage.\n\n**MITRE technique IDs**\n\nT1087, T1482, T1069",

The list includes many IDs, but we need to identify which techniques are described.\n\nText summary: ADVSTORESHELL is a spying backdoor. Activities:\n\n- Long-term espionage after reconnaissance (maybe \"Gather Victim Host Information\" etc but not explicit)\n- Communicates with C2 via port 80 using Wininet API, exchanging data via HTTP POST requests. That's \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) or \"Web Protocols\"? T1071 is Application Layer Protocol. Also \"Non-Standard Port\" (T1571) because using port 80 is standard HTTP, but maybe not. Actually port 80 is standard, so not non-standard. Could be \"Web Service\" (T1102) but that's for using web services for C2. Here it's HTTP POST, so T1071.\n\n- Data encryption using 3DES with hardcoded key before exfiltration. That's \"Data Encrypted for Impact\" (T1486) or \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) or \"Data Encoding\" (T1132) but encryption is for confidentiality, not impact. MITRE has \"Encrypt Data\" under Exfiltration? Actually T1041 is Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, but encryption is \"Obfuscated/Encrypted Network Traffic\" maybe \"Encrypted Channel\" (T1573). However T1573 is Encrypted Channel (C2). The text says C2 traffic is encrypted and then Base64 encoded. That's \"Encrypted Channel\" (T1573) and \"Data Encoding\" (T1132). Also \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) could apply.\n\n- Persistence via adding itself to HKCU\\...Run registry key. That's \"Modify Registry\" (T1112) or \"Registry Run Keys/Startup Folder\" (T1547.001). Since subtechnique, main technique is \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" (T1547). So we map to T1547.\n\n- Create remote shell and execute commands, output stored in .dat file in %TEMP%. That's \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) for command execution, also \"Remote Services\" maybe \"Remote Access Software\" (T1219) but remote shell is a capability. Could be \"Remote Service Session Hijacking\" (T1563) but not. Likely \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059). Also \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) but not explicit.\n\n- C2 traffic encrypted and encoded with Base64. Already covered.\n\nThus techniques identified: T1071 (Application Layer Protocol), T1573 (Encrypted Channel), T1132 (Data Encoding), T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information) maybe, T1547 (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution), T1112 (Modify Registry), T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter). Also maybe \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) because exfiltration via C2. But not explicit. Could include \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041). Also \"Data Encrypted for Impact\" (T1486) but that's for impact, not exfil. Might not.\n\nWe need to map each to ID and provide reasoning.\n\nFinal line: list IDs for main techniques, excluding subtechnique IDs. So include T1071, T1573, T1132, T1027, T1547, T1112, T1059, T1041 maybe.

Before exfiltration, the backdoor encrypts data using the 3DES algorithm with a hardcoded key. Persistence is achieved by adding itself to the HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run Registry key. ADVSTORESHELL can create a remote shell and execute specified commands, with command execution output stored in a .dat file in the %TEMP% directory. Its C2 traffic is encrypted and then encoded with Base64. Some variants of ADVSTORESHELL also use 3DES encryption for C2 communications."

        "6fa55f7435547ff9e94eb8992026dc4f": "We need to extract MITRE Enterprise attack patterns (techniques) from the text, map to IDs, provide reasoning, and final line only IDs for main techniques (excluding subtechnique IDs). The list includes many IDs, but we need to identify which techniques are described.\n\nText summary: ADVSTORESHELL is a spying backdoor. Activities:\n\n- Long-term espionage after reconnaissance (maybe \"Gather Victim Host Information\" etc but not explicit)\n- Communicates with C2 via port 80 using Wininet API, exchanging data via HTTP POST requests. That's \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) or \"Web Protocols\"? T1071 is Application Layer Protocol. Also \"Non-Standard Port\" (T1571) because using port 80 is standard HTTP, but maybe not. Actually port 80 is standard, so not non-standard. Could be \"Web Service\" (T1102) but that's for using web services for C2. Here it's HTTP POST, so T1071.\n\n- Data encryption using 3DES with hardcoded key before exfiltration. That's \"Data Encrypted for Impact\" (T1486) or \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) or \"Data Encoding\" (T1132) but encryption is for confidentiality, not impact. MITRE has \"Encrypt Data\" under Exfiltration? Actually T1041 is Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, but encryption is \"Obfuscated/Encrypted Network Traffic\" maybe \"Encrypted Channel\" (T1573). However T1573 is Encrypted Channel (C2). The text says C2 traffic is encrypted and then Base64 encoded. That's \"Encrypted Channel\" (T1573) and \"Data Encoding\" (T1132). Also \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) could apply.\n\n- Persistence via adding itself to HKCU\\...Run registry key. That's \"Modify Registry\" (T1112) or \"Registry Run Keys/Startup Folder\" (T1547.001). Since subtechnique, main technique is \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" (T1547). So we map to T1547.\n\n- Create remote shell and execute commands, output stored in .dat file in %TEMP%. That's \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) for command execution, also \"Remote Services\" maybe \"Remote Access Software\" (T1219) but remote shell is a capability. Could be \"Remote Service Session Hijacking\" (T1563) but not. Likely \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059). Also \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) but not explicit.\n\n- C2 traffic encrypted and encoded with Base64. Already covered.\n\nThus techniques identified: T1071 (Application Layer Protocol), T1573 (Encrypted Channel), T1132 (Data Encoding), T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information) maybe, T1547 (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution), T1112 (Modify Registry), T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter). Also maybe \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) because exfiltration via C2. But not explicit. Could include \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041). Also \"Data Encrypted for Impact\" (T1486) but that's for impact, not exfil. Might not.\n\nWe need to map each to ID and provide reasoning.\n\nFinal line: list IDs for main techniques, excluding subtechnique IDs. So include T1071, T1573, T1132, T1027, T1547, T1112, T1059, T1041 maybe. Ensure no subtechnique IDs like T1547.001.\n\nLet's decide final IDs: T1071, T1573, T1132, T1027, T1547, T1112, T1059, T1041.\n\nCheck list includes those IDs: Yes.\n\nNow produce answer with reasoning for each identification.",

By July 2019, Agent Smith had infected approximately 25 million devices, primarily targeting users in India, but also impacting other Asian countries, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Agent Smith can inject fraudulent ad modules into existing applications on a device and exploits known OS vulnerabilities, such as Janus, to replace legitimate apps with malicious versions. The malware is designed to display fraudulent ads to generate revenue. It can also hide its icon from the application launcher and delete update packages of infected apps to prevent them from being updated. The malware can impersonate any popular application on an infected device, with its core component disguising itself as a legitimate Google app. The dropper used to deliver Agent Smith is a weaponized version of a legitimate Feng Shui Bundle. Additionally, the core malware is disguised as a JPG file and encrypted with an XOR cipher.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1134

MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** Agent Smith is mobile malware that generates financial profit by replacing legitimate apps on infected devices with malicious versions that contain fraudulent ads. By July 2019, Agent Smith had infected approximately 25 million devices, primarily targeting users in India, but also impacting other Asian countries, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Agent Smith can inject fraudulent ad modules into existing applications on a device and exploits known OS vulnerabilities, such as Janus, to replace legitimate apps with malicious versions. The malware is designed to display fraudulent ads to generate revenue. It can also hide its icon from the application launcher and delete update packages of infected apps to prevent them from being updated. The malware can impersonate any popular application on an infected device, with its core component disguising itself as a legitimate Google app. The dropper used to deliver Agent Smith is a weaponized version of a legitimate Feng Shui Bundle. Additionally, the core malware is disguised as a JPG file and encrypted with an XOR cipher.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1134

It injects fraudulent ad modules into existing apps, exploits known OS vulnerabilities (Janus) to replace legitimate apps. It hides its icon from launcher, deletes update packages to prevent updates. It impersonates popular apps, core component disguises as legitimate Google app. Dropper is weaponized version of legitimate Feng Shui Bundle. Core malware disguised as JPG file and encrypted with XOR cipher.\n\nSo techniques:\n\n- Replace legitimate apps with malicious versions: This is \"Modify Existing Service\"? Actually replacing apps is \"Modify Existing Software\" maybe \"Modify Existing System Process\"? Could be \"Modify Existing Software\" not in list. Could be \"Exploitation for Client Execution\" (T1203) to exploit OS vulnerabilities to install malicious app \"Masquerading\" (T1036) for disguising as legitimate app, icon hiding, impersonation. Also \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) for XOR encryption and disguised as JPG. Also \"\" (T1564) for hiding icon. Also \"Modify Registry\"? Not mentioned. \"Delete update packages\" is \"Delete Files\" maybe \"Indicator Removal\" (T1070) but that's for logs. Could be \"Modify System Image\"? Not. \"Supply Chain Compromise\" maybe using weaponized legitimate bundle (Feng Shui Bundle) as dropper: that's \"Supply Chain Compromise\" (T1195). Also \"Install malicious app via exploit\" could be \"Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\" (T1068) if OS vulnerability. But more likely \"Exploitation for Client Execution\" (T1203). Also \"Ad Injection\" maybe \"Content Injection\" (T1655? Actually list includes T1655? Not, but there is T1655? Not in list. There's T1655 not present. There's T1655? Not. There's T1655 not.

It injects fraudulent ad modules into existing apps, exploits known OS vulnerabilities (Janus) to replace legitimate apps. It hides its icon from launcher, deletes update packages to prevent updates. It impersonates popular apps, core component disguises as legitimate Google app. Dropper is weaponized version of legitimate Feng Shui Bundle. Core malware disguised as JPG file and encrypted with XOR cipher.\n\nSo techniques:\n\n- Replace legitimate apps with malicious versions: This is \"Modify Existing Service\"? Actually replacing apps is \"Modify Existing Software\" maybe \"Modify Existing System Process\"? Could be \"Modify Existing Software\" not in list. Could be \"Exploitation for Client Execution\" (T1203) to exploit OS vulnerabilities to install malicious app \"Masquerading\" (T1036) for disguising as legitimate app, icon hiding, impersonation. Also \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) for XOR encryption and disguised as JPG. Also \"\" (T1564) for hiding icon. Also \"Modify Registry\"? Not mentioned. \"Delete update packages\" is \"Delete Files\" maybe \"Indicator Removal\" (T1070) but that's for logs. Could be \"Modify System Image\"? Not. \"Supply Chain Compromise\" maybe using weaponized legitimate bundle (Feng Shui Bundle) as dropper: that's \"Supply Chain Compromise\" (T1195). Also \"Install malicious app via exploit\" could be \"Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\" (T1068) if OS vulnerability. But more likely \"Exploitation for Client Execution\" (T1203). Also \"Ad Injection\" maybe \"Content Injection\" (T1655? Actually list includes T1655? Not, but there is T1655? Not in list. There's T1655 not present. There's T1655? Not. There's T1655 not.

        "description": "Agent Smith is mobile malware that generates financial profit by replacing legitimate apps on infected devices with malicious versions that contain fraudulent ads. By July 2019, Agent Smith had infected approximately 25 million devices, primarily targeting users in India, but also impacting other Asian countries, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Agent Smith can inject fraudulent ad modules into existing applications on a device and exploits known OS vulnerabilities, such as Janus, to replace legitimate apps with malicious versions. The malware is designed to display fraudulent ads to generate revenue. It can also hide its icon from the application launcher and delete update packages of infected apps to prevent them from being updated. The malware can impersonate any popular application on an infected device, with its core component disguising itself as a legitimate Google app. The dropper used to deliver Agent Smith is a weaponized version of a legitimate Feng Shui Bundle. Additionally, the core malware is disguised as a JPG file and encrypted with an XOR cipher."

              "description": "Agent Smith is mobile malware that generates financial profit by replacing legitimate apps on infected devices with malicious versions that contain fraudulent ads. By July 2019, Agent Smith had infected approximately 25 million devices, primarily targeting users in India, but also impacting other Asian countries, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Agent Smith can inject fraudulent ad modules into existing applications on a device and exploits known OS vulnerabilities, such as Janus, to replace legitimate apps with malicious versions. The malware is designed to display fraudulent ads to generate revenue. It can also hide its icon from the application launcher and delete update packages of infected apps to prevent them from being updated. The malware can impersonate any popular application on an infected device, with its core component disguising itself as a legitimate Google app. The dropper used to deliver Agent Smith is a weaponized version of a legitimate Feng Shui Bundle. Additionally, the core malware is disguised as a JPG file and encrypted with an XOR cipher."

Actually replacing apps is \"Modify Existing Software\" maybe \"Modify Existing System Process\"? Could be \"Modify Existing Software\" not in list. Could be \"Exploitation for Client Execution\" (T1203) to exploit OS vulnerabilities to install malicious app \"Masquerading\" (T1036) for disguising as legitimate app, icon hiding, impersonation. Also \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) for XOR encryption and disguised as JPG. Also \"\" (T1564) for hiding icon. Also \"Modify Registry\"? Not mentioned. \"Delete update packages\" is \"Delete Files\" maybe \"Indicator Removal\" (T1070) but that's for logs. Could be \"Modify System Image\"? Not. \"Supply Chain Compromise\" maybe using weaponized legitimate bundle (Feng Shui Bundle) as dropper: that's \"Supply Chain Compromise\" (T1195). Also \"Install malicious app via exploit\" could be \"Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\" (T1068) if OS vulnerability. But more likely \"Exploitation for Client Execution\" (T1203). Also \"Ad Injection\" maybe \"Content Injection\" (T1655? Actually list includes T1655? Not, but there is T1655? Not in list. There's T1655 not present. There's T1655? Not. There's T1655 not.

              "reasoning": "We need to extract all MITRE Enterprise attack patterns (techniques) from the given text, map to IDs, provide reasoning for each identification. Then final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. So we need to identify which techniques are described.\n\nText: \"Agent Tesla is a spyware Trojan built on the .NET framework, active since at least 2014. It is capable of collecting account information from the victim’s machine and has been observed using HTTP for command and control (C2) communications. Agent Tesla can encrypt data using the 3DES algorithm before transmitting it to a C2 server. To establish persistence, it adds itself to the system Registry as a startup program. The Trojan can perform form-grabbing to capture data from web forms and is also capable of stealing data from the victim’s clipboard. Additionally, Agent Tesla can extract credentials from FTP clients and wireless profiles. It has the ability to decrypt strings that have been encrypted using the Rijndael symmetric encryption algorithm.\"\n\nIdentify techniques:\n\n- Collecting account information from victim's machine: This is credential dumping? \"Account information\" maybe \"Credentials from Password Stores\" (T1555) or \"Credentials from Web Browsers\"? Not listed. Could be \"Credentials from Password Stores\" (T1555). Also \"Credential Access\" from FTP clients and wireless profiles: That's \"Credentials from Web Browsers\"? Not in list. There's \"Credentials from Password Stores\" (T1555) includes browsers, FTP clients, wireless profiles. So map to T1555.\n\n- Using HTTP for C2 communications: That's \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) (since HTTP is application layer). Also could be \"Web Service\" (T1102) but HTTP C2 is typical of T1071. So T1071.\n\n- Encrypt data using 3DES before transmitting: That's \"Data Encrypted for Impact\"? Actually encryption for exfil is \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) maybe with encryption. But there is \"Data Encoding\" (T1132) or \"Data Encrypted for Impact\" (T1486) but that's for impact. There's also \"Obfuscate/Encode Files or Information\" (T1027) but encryption is a form of \"Data Encoding\". However MITRE has technique \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) which includes encrypting data. But the text says encrypt data before transmitting to C2. Could map to \"Data Encoding\" (T1132) or \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027). The list includes T1132: Data Encoding. We'll choose T1132.\n\n- Persistence by adding itself to system Registry as a startup program: That's \"Modify Registry\" (T1112) or \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" (T1547). Specifically adding to Registry Run key is T1547.001 (Registry Run Keys/Startup Folder) subtechnique, but we need main technique ID: T1547 (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution). Also could be \"Modify Registry\" (T1112) but primary is persistence. We'll map to T1547.\n\n- Form-grabbing to capture data from web forms: That's \"Input Capture\" (T1056) subtechnique \"Web Forms\". Main technique T1056.\n\n- Stealing data from clipboard: also Input Capture (T1056) subtechnique \"Clipboard Data\". So T1056 again.\n\n- Extract credentials from FTP clients and wireless profiles: again Credential Access: \"Credentials from Password Stores\" (T1555) or \"Credentials from Web Browsers\"? Not in list. We'll map to T1555.\n\n- Ability to decrypt strings encrypted using Rijndael: That's \"Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\" (T1140) maybe. Or \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027). Since decrypting strings is decoding. So T1140.\n\nAlso \"collecting account information\" could be \"Account Discovery\" (T1087) but that's about enumerating accounts, not stealing credentials. The phrase \"collecting account information from the victim’s machine\" ambiguous. Could be \"Account Discovery\". We'll include T1087.\n\nAlso \"collecting account information\" maybe \"Credential Dumping\" (T1003) but not mentioned OS credential dumping. We'll stick with T1087 for discovery and T1555 for credential theft.\n\nNow list of identified techniques with IDs:\n\n- T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) – HTTP C2.\n- T1132 (Data Encoding) – encrypt data before transmission.\n- T1547 (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution) – Registry startup persistence.\n- T1112 (Modify Registry) – also modifies registry (but maybe not needed if we already have T1547). Could include both. But we need main techniques; both are separate. The text says adds itself to system Registry as a startup program. That's both modify registry and autostart. Could map to both T1112 and T1547. We'll include both.\n\n- T1056 (Input Capture) – form-grabbing and clipboard.\n- T1555 (Credentials from Password Stores) – extracting credentials from FTP clients and wireless profiles, also account info.\n- T1087 (Account Discovery) – collecting account information (maybe).\n- T1140 (Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information) – decrypt strings.\n\nPotential also T1071 includes subtechnique \"Web Protocols\". Good.\n\nNow we need reasoning for each.\n\nFinally final line: IDs for main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs. Should we include duplicates? No. List unique IDs: T1071, T1132, T1547, T1112, T1056, T1555, T1087, T1140.\n\nCheck if any other technique: \"collecting account information\" could also be \"Credential Access\" but we already have T1555. \"Collecting account information\" could be \"Account Discovery\" (T1087). We'll keep both.\n\nNow produce answer with reasoning and final line.\n\n",

                  "reasoning": "We need to extract all MITRE Enterprise attack patterns (techniques) from the given text, map to IDs, provide reasoning for each identification. Then final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. So we need to identify which techniques are described.\n\nText: \"Agent Tesla is a spyware Trojan built on the .NET framework, active since at least 2014. It is capable of collecting account information from the victim’s machine and has been observed using HTTP for command and control (C2) communications. Agent Tesla can encrypt data using the 3DES algorithm before transmitting it to a C2 server. To establish persistence, it adds itself to the system Registry as a startup program. The Trojan can perform form-grabbing to capture data from web forms and is also capable of stealing data from the victim’s clipboard. Additionally, Agent Tesla can extract credentials from FTP clients and wireless profiles. It has the ability to decrypt strings that have been encrypted using the Rijndael symmetric encryption algorithm.\"\n\nIdentify techniques:\n\n- Collecting account information from victim's machine: This is credential dumping? \"Account information\" maybe \"Credentials from Password Stores\" (T1555) or \"Credentials from Web Browsers\"? Not listed. Could be \"Credentials from Password Stores\" (T1555). Also \"Credential Access\" from FTP clients and wireless profiles: That's \"Credentials from Web Browsers\"? Not in list. There's \"Credentials from Password Stores\" (T1555) includes browsers, FTP clients, wireless profiles. So map to T1555.\n\n- Using HTTP for C2 communications: That's \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) (since HTTP is application layer). Also could be \"Web Service\" (T1102) but HTTP C2 is typical of T1071. So T1071.\n\n- Encrypt data using 3DES before transmitting: That's \"Data Encrypted for Impact\"? Actually encryption for exfil is \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) maybe with encryption. But there is \"Data Encoding\" (T1132) or \"Data Encrypted for Impact\" (T1486) but that's for impact. There's also \"Obfuscate/Encode Files or Information\" (T1027) but encryption is a form of \"Data Encoding\". However MITRE has technique \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) which includes encrypting data. But the text says encrypt data before transmitting to C2. Could map to \"Data Encoding\" (T1132) or \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027). The list includes T1132: Data Encoding. We'll choose T1132.\n\n- Persistence by adding itself to system Registry as a startup program: That's \"Modify Registry\" (T1112) or \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" (T1547). Specifically adding to Registry Run key is T1547.001 (Registry Run Keys/Startup Folder) subtechnique, but we need main technique ID: T1547 (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution). Also could be \"Modify Registry\" (T1112) but primary is persistence. We'll map to T1547.\n\n- Form-grabbing to capture data from web forms: That's \"Input Capture\" (T1056) subtechnique \"Web Forms\". Main technique T1056.\n\n- Stealing data from clipboard: also Input Capture (T1056) subtechnique \"Clipboard Data\". So T1056 again.\n\n- Extract credentials from FTP clients and wireless profiles: again Credential Access: \"Credentials from Password Stores\" (T1555) or \"Credentials from Web Browsers\"? Not in list. We'll map to T1555.\n\n- Ability to decrypt strings encrypted using Rijndael: That's \"Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\" (T1140) maybe. Or \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027). Since decrypting strings is decoding. So T1140.\n\nAlso \"collecting account information\" could be \"Account Discovery\" (T1087) but that's about enumerating accounts, not stealing credentials. The phrase \"collecting account information from the victim’s machine\" ambiguous. Could be \"Account Discovery\". We'll include T1087.\n\nAlso \"collecting account information\" maybe \"Credential Dumping\" (T1003) but not mentioned OS credential dumping. We'll stick with T1087 for discovery and T1555 for credential theft.\n\nNow list of identified techniques with IDs:\n\n- T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) – HTTP C2.\n- T1132 (Data Encoding) – encrypt data before transmission.\n- T1547 (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution) – Registry startup persistence.\n- T1112 (Modify Registry) – also modifies registry (but maybe not needed if we already have T1547). Could include both. But we need main techniques; both are separate. The text says adds itself to system Registry as a startup program. That's both modify registry and autostart. Could map to both T1112 and T1547. We'll include both.\n\n- T1056 (Input Capture) – form-grabbing and clipboard.\n- T1555 (Credentials from Password Stores) – extracting credentials from FTP clients and wireless profiles, also account info.\n- T1087 (Account Discovery) – collecting account information (maybe).\n- T1140 (Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information) – decrypt strings.\n\nPotential also T1071 includes subtechnique \"Web Protocols\". Good.\n\nNow we need reasoning for each.\n\nFinally final line: IDs for main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs. Should we include duplicates? No. List unique IDs: T1071, T1132, T1547, T1112, T1056, T1555, T1087, T1140.\n\nCheck if any other technique: \"collecting account information\" could also be \"Credential Access\" but we already have T1555. \"Collecting account information\" could be \"Account Discovery\" (T1087). We'll keep both.\n\nNow produce answer with reasoning and final line.\n\n",

        "d7d907d88d6b55215a49c8aaf32246c3": "We need to extract all MITRE Enterprise attack patterns (techniques) from the given text, map to IDs, provide reasoning for each identification. Then final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. So we need to identify which techniques are described.\n\nText: \"Agent Tesla is a spyware Trojan built on the .NET framework, active since at least 2014. It is capable of collecting account information from the victim’s machine and has been observed using HTTP for command and control (C2) communications. Agent Tesla can encrypt data using the 3DES algorithm before transmitting it to a C2 server. To establish persistence, it adds itself to the system Registry as a startup program. The Trojan can perform form-grabbing to capture data from web forms and is also capable of stealing data from the victim’s clipboard. Additionally, Agent Tesla can extract credentials from FTP clients and wireless profiles. It has the ability to decrypt strings that have been encrypted using the Rijndael symmetric encryption algorithm.\"\n\nIdentify techniques:\n\n- Collecting account information from victim's machine: This is credential dumping? \"Account information\" maybe \"Credentials from Password Stores\" (T1555) or \"Credentials from Web Browsers\"? Not listed. Could be \"Credentials from Password Stores\" (T1555). Also \"Credential Access\" from FTP clients and wireless profiles: That's \"Credentials from Web Browsers\"? Not in list. There's \"Credentials from Password Stores\" (T1555) includes browsers, FTP clients, wireless profiles. So map to T1555.\n\n- Using HTTP for C2 communications: That's \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) (since HTTP is application layer). Also could be \"Web Service\" (T1102) but HTTP C2 is typical of T1071. So T1071.\n\n- Encrypt data using 3DES before transmitting: That's \"Data Encrypted for Impact\"? Actually encryption for exfil is \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) maybe with encryption. But there is \"Data Encoding\" (T1132) or \"Data Encrypted for Impact\" (T1486) but that's for impact. There's also \"Obfuscate/Encode Files or Information\" (T1027) but encryption is a form of \"Data Encoding\". However MITRE has technique \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) which includes encrypting data. But the text says encrypt data before transmitting to C2. Could map to \"Data Encoding\" (T1132) or \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027). The list includes T1132: Data Encoding. We'll choose T1132.\n\n- Persistence by adding itself to system Registry as a startup program: That's \"Modify Registry\" (T1112) or \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" (T1547). Specifically adding to Registry Run key is T1547.001 (Registry Run Keys/Startup Folder) subtechnique, but we need main technique ID: T1547 (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution). Also could be \"Modify Registry\" (T1112) but primary is persistence. We'll map to T1547.\n\n- Form-grabbing to capture data from web forms: That's \"Input Capture\" (T1056) subtechnique \"Web Forms\". Main technique T1056.\n\n- Stealing data from clipboard: also Input Capture (T1056) subtechnique \"Clipboard Data\". So T1056 again.\n\n- Extract credentials from FTP clients and wireless profiles: again Credential Access: \"Credentials from Password Stores\" (T1555) or \"Credentials from Web Browsers\"? Not in list. We'll map to T1555.\n\n- Ability to decrypt strings encrypted using Rijndael: That's \"Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\" (T1140) maybe. Or \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027). Since decrypting strings is decoding. So T1140.\n\nAlso \"collecting account information\" could be \"Account Discovery\" (T1087) but that's about enumerating accounts, not stealing credentials. The phrase \"collecting account information from the victim’s machine\" ambiguous. Could be \"Account Discovery\". We'll include T1087.\n\nAlso \"collecting account information\" maybe \"Credential Dumping\" (T1003) but not mentioned OS credential dumping. We'll stick with T1087 for discovery and T1555 for credential theft.\n\nNow list of identified techniques with IDs:\n\n- T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) – HTTP C2.\n- T1132 (Data Encoding) – encrypt data before transmission.\n- T1547 (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution) – Registry startup persistence.\n- T1112 (Modify Registry) – also modifies registry (but maybe not needed if we already have T1547). Could include both. But we need main techniques; both are separate. The text says adds itself to system Registry as a startup program. That's both modify registry and autostart. Could map to both T1112 and T1547. We'll include both.\n\n- T1056 (Input Capture) – form-grabbing and clipboard.\n- T1555 (Credentials from Password Stores) – extracting credentials from FTP clients and wireless profiles, also account info.\n- T1087 (Account Discovery) – collecting account information (maybe).\n- T1140 (Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information) – decrypt strings.\n\nPotential also T1071 includes subtechnique \"Web Protocols\". Good.\n\nNow we need reasoning for each.\n\nFinally final line: IDs for main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs. Should we include duplicates? No. List unique IDs: T1071, T1132, T1547, T1112, T1056, T1555, T1087, T1140.\n\nCheck if any other technique: \"collecting account information\" could also be \"Credential Access\" but we already have T1555. \"Collecting account information\" could be \"Account Discovery\" (T1087). We'll keep both.\n\nNow produce answer with reasoning and final line.\n\n",

On any connected USB flash drive, Agent.btz creates a file named \"thumb.dd\" that contains details about the infected system and activity logs. The worm also attempts to download an encrypted binary from a specified domain. To propagate itself, Agent.btz drops a copy of itself onto removable media and creates an autorun.inf file that instructs the system to execute the malware when the device is inserted into another computer. Additionally, Agent.btz collects network-related information, including the IP and MAC addresses of the network adapter, as well as IP addresses for the default gateway, WINS, DHCP, and DNS servers, and saves this data into a log file. The worm also records the victim's username and stores it in a separate file.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1134 : Access

The text describes:\n\n- Spreading via removable devices (USB) -> technique: \"Replication Through Removable Media\" (T1091). Also \"Exfiltration Over Physical Medium\"? Not exactly. Also \"Removable Media\" usage for propagation: T1091.\n\n- Creates autorun.inf to execute when device inserted -> \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" (T1547) subtechnique \"Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder\"? Actually autorun.inf is \"Autostart Execution\" maybe T1547. Also \"Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts\" (T1037) maybe. But main technique is T1547.\n\n- Gathers system information, saves to XML, XOR-encoded -> \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) for encoding, also \"Data Encoding\" (T1132) maybe. Also \"System Information Discovery\" (T1082). Also \"Gather Victim Host Information\" (T1592) but that's subtech? Actually T1592 is \"Gather Victim Identity Information\". For host info it's T1082. So include T1082.\n\n- Collects network-related info: IP, MAC, gateway, DNS, etc. That's \"System Network Configuration Discovery\" (T1016) and maybe \"Network Service Discovery\" (T1046) but more config. So T1016.\n\n- Records username -> \"System Owner/User Discovery\" (T1033).\n\n- Attempts to download an encrypted binary from domain -> \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1105) or \"Remote File Copy\"? Not in list. T1105 is \"Ingress Tool Transfer\". Also \"Encrypted Channel\" (T1573) maybe for download but not explicit. So T1105.\n\n- Saves data to log file -> \"Data Staged\" (T1074) maybe. Also \"Archive Collected Data\" (T1560) not mentioned. So maybe T1074.\n\n- Creates file on USB \"thumb.dd\" containing details -> \"Exfiltration Over Physical Medium\" (T1052) maybe but that's for exfil. Not necessarily. Could be \"Data from Removable Media\" (T1025) but that's collection. The worm writes to removable media for propagation, not exfil. So maybe not.\n\n- The worm is a worm, spreads via removable media -> \"Replication Through Removable Media\" (T1091) already.\n\n- Also \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) maybe for execution but not described.\n\n- \"Obfuscation\" via XOR encoding -> \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) and \"Data Encoding\" (T1132).

Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105) – attempts to download encrypted binary.\n9. Data Staged (T1074) – saves info to files before exfil.\nPotentially also:\n10.

MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** Agent.btz is a worm known for spreading primarily through removable devices like USB drives. It gained notoriety for infecting U.S. military networks in 2008. The worm gathers system information and saves it in an XML file, which is then XOR-encoded for obfuscation. On any connected USB flash drive, Agent.btz creates a file named \"thumb.dd\" that contains details about the infected system and activity logs. The worm also attempts to download an encrypted binary from a specified domain. To propagate itself, Agent.btz drops a copy of itself onto removable media and creates an autorun.inf file that instructs the system to execute the malware when the device is inserted into another computer. Additionally, Agent.btz collects network-related information, including the IP and MAC addresses of the network adapter, as well as IP addresses for the default gateway, WINS, DHCP, and DNS servers, and saves this data into a log file.

Also \"System Information Discovery\" (T1082). Also \"Gather Victim Host Information\" (T1592) but that's subtech? Actually T1592 is \"Gather Victim Identity Information\". For host info it's T1082. So include T1082.\n\n- Collects network-related info: IP, MAC, gateway, DNS, etc. That's \"System Network Configuration Discovery\" (T1016) and maybe \"Network Service Discovery\" (T1046) but more config. So T1016.\n\n- Records username -> \"System Owner/User Discovery\" (T1033).\n\n- Attempts to download an encrypted binary from domain -> \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1105) or \"Remote File Copy\"? Not in list. T1105 is \"Ingress Tool Transfer\". Also \"Encrypted Channel\" (T1573) maybe for download but not explicit. So T1105.\n\n- Saves data to log file -> \"Data Staged\" (T1074) maybe. Also \"Archive Collected Data\" (T1560) not mentioned. So maybe T1074.\n\n- Creates file on USB \"thumb.dd\" containing details -> \"Exfiltration Over Physical Medium\" (T1052) maybe but that's for exfil. Not necessarily. Could be \"Data from Removable Media\" (T1025) but that's collection. The worm writes to removable media for propagation, not exfil. So maybe not.\n\n- The worm is a worm, spreads via removable media -> \"Replication Through Removable Media\" (T1091) already.\n\n- Also \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) maybe for execution but not described.\n\n- \"Obfuscation\" via XOR encoding -> \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) and \"Data Encoding\" (T1132). Also \"Data Obfuscation\" (T1001) maybe.\n\nWe need to map each identified technique to ID from list.\n\nList includes IDs and names. Let's match:\n\n- T1091 : Replication Through Removable Media (present)\n- T1547 : Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (present)\n- T1082 : System Information Discovery (present)\n- T1027 : Obfuscated Files or Information (present)\n- T1132 : Data Encoding (present)\n- T1016 : System Network Configuration Discovery (present)\n- T1033 : System Owner/User Discovery (present)\n- T1105 : Ingress Tool Transfer (present)\n- T1074 : Data Staged (present)\n- Possibly T1083 : File and Directory Discovery? Not described.\n- T1047 : Windows Management Instrumentation? Not.\n\nAlso \"Data from Removable Media\" T1025 maybe but not described as collection from removable media; it's writing to it. Could be \"Exfiltration Over Physical Medium\" T1052 but not in list? Actually T1052 is \"Exfiltration Over Physical Medium\". It's in list. Could be considered but not main.\n\nBut we need to extract all attack patterns from text. So include those that are clearly described.\n\nLet's list:\n\n1. Replication Through Removable Media (T1091) – spreading via USB.\n2. Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (T1547) – autorun.inf.\n3. System Information Discovery (T1082) – gathers system info.\n4. Obfuscated Files or Information (T1027) – XOR-encoded XML.\n5. Data Encoding (T1132) – XOR encoding qualifies as encoding.\n6. System Network Configuration Discovery (T1016) – collects IP, MAC, DNS, etc.\n7. System Owner/User Discovery (T1033) – records username.\n8. Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105) – attempts to download encrypted binary.\n9. Data Staged (T1074) – saves info to files before exfil.\nPotentially also:\n10. Data from Removable Media (T1025) – writes data to USB (but that's not collection). Might be \"Exfiltration Over Physical Medium\" (T1052) – but not exfil. So maybe not.\n\nAlso \"Data Obfuscation\" (T1001) could be considered but overlapping with T1027. We'll stick with T1027.\n\nNow provide reasoning for each.\n\nFinally final line: list IDs separated by commas, only main techniques (no subtech). So list: T1091,T1547,T1082,T1027,T1132,T1016,T1033,T1105,T1074\n\nMake sure order maybe as identified.\n\nNow produce answer.",

MITRE Mobile IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** AhRat is an Android remote access tool (RAT) derived from the open-source AhMyth RAT. It began spreading in August 2022 through an update to the previously benign app \"iRecorder – Screen Recorder,\" which was originally released on the Google Play Store in September 2021. AhRat is capable of communicating with its command and control (C2) server via HTTPS requests. It can record audio using the device’s microphone and register with the BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast to start automatically when the device is powered on.

AhRat is capable of communicating with its command and control (C2) server via HTTPS requests. It can record audio using the device’s microphone and register with the BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast to start automatically when the device is powered on.

Then final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. The list given includes only main technique IDs (no subtechnique). So we need to identify which techniques are described.\n\nText mentions:\n\n- Android RAT, spreading via update to benign app (Supply Chain Compromise?) That's T1474: Supply Chain Compromise.\n\n- Communicating via HTTPS requests (C2 channel) => Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1646) maybe also Encrypted Channel (T1521) but HTTPS is encrypted. Could be \"Encrypted Channel\". But we need to map to technique IDs present. Both exist. Which is more appropriate? \"communicating with its command and control (C2) server via HTTPS requests.\" That's a C2 channel, so T1646.\n\n- Record audio using microphone => Audio Capture (T1429).\n\n- Register with BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast to start automatically when device powered on => Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts (T1398) maybe also \"Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts\". Yes.\n\n- Search for and exfiltrate files with specific extensions, enumerate files stored on external storage => File and Directory Discovery (T1420) and Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (already). Also Data from Local System (T1533) maybe. But \"search for and exfiltrate files\" is discovery and exfil. We'll map to File and Directory Discovery (T1420) and Data from Local System (T1533) maybe. But we need to list each technique identified.\n\n- Register with CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE and WIFI_STATE_CHANGED broadcast events to trigger further functionality => Event Triggered Execution (T1624) maybe also \"Event Triggered Execution\". Yes.\n\n- Track device's location => Location Tracking (T1430).\n\n- Exfiltrate collected data, including audio recordings and files, to C2 server => Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1646) again.\n\n- Also \"update to previously benign app\" is supply chain compromise.\n\n- Possibly \"HTTPS requests\" also \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1437) but that's about using application layer protocols for C2. Could be. But we already have Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. Might include both. But we need to map each pattern.\n\nList of IDs we have identified:\n\nT1474 (Supply Chain Compromise)\nT1646 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel)\nT1429 (Audio Capture)\nT1398 (Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts)\nT1420 (File and Directory Discovery)\nT1624 (Event Triggered Execution)\nT1430 (Location Tracking)\n\nPotentially also T1533 (Data from Local System) but that's about collecting data from local system. The text says \"search for and exfiltrate files\". That's data collection. Could be Data from Local System. But we already have File and Directory Discovery and Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. Data from Local System is about collecting data. Might include. Let's include.\n\nAlso T1437 (Application Layer Protocol) for HTTPS. Might include.\n\nAlso T1664 (Exploitation for Initial Access) not described. No.\n\nAlso T1655 (Masquerading) maybe because the app disguised as iRecorder. That's supply chain but also masquerading. The text says \"update to previously benign app\". That's supply chain. Masquerading is about pretending to be legitimate. Could be. But we can include.\n\nBut we need to ensure final line only includes IDs for main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs. All IDs are main. So final line list all IDs we identified, maybe sorted.\n\nLet's decide which to include: The question: \"Extract all MITRE Mobile attack patterns from the following text and map them to their corresponding MITRE technique IDs.\" So we need to list each pattern we find. So include all relevant ones.\n\nThus list:\n\n- Supply Chain Compromise – T1474\n- Exfiltration Over C2 Channel – T1646\n- Audio Capture – T1429\n- Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts – T1398\n- File and Directory Discovery – T1420\n- Event Triggered Execution – T1624\n- Location Tracking – T1430\n- Data from Local System – T1533\n- Application Layer Protocol – T1437 (HTTPS)\n- Masquerading – T1655 (disguised as legitimate app)\n\nCheck if any other: \"register with CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE and WIFI_STATE_CHANGED broadcast events\" could also be \"Network Service Scanning\"? No. It's event triggered.\n\n\"search for and exfiltrate files with specific extensions\" also \"Archive Collected Data\" (T1532) maybe not.\n\n\"exfiltrate files\" already covered.\n\nThus final IDs: T1474, T1646, T1429, T1398, T1420, T1624, T1430, T1533, T1437, T1655\n\nProvide reasoning for each.\n\nNow produce answer with bullet list mapping and reasoning, then final line with IDs separated by commas.",

Then final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. The list of IDs given are all main technique IDs (no subtech). We need to find which techniques are described in the text.\n\nText: \"Allwinner is a company that provides processors for Android tablets and various other devices. A Linux kernel distributed by Allwinner for these devices reportedly contained a simple backdoor that could be exploited to gain root access. It is believed that this backdoor was unintentionally left in the kernel by its developers.\"\n\nKey points: Linux kernel backdoor, exploited to gain root access. This is about exploitation for privilege escalation (gain root). Also could be \"Exploitation for Initial Access\"? But the backdoor is in kernel, exploited to gain root. The technique likely \"Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\" (T1404). Also maybe \"Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism\" (T1626) because backdoor in kernel could be used to bypass elevation controls. But the description: \"simple backdoor that could be exploited to gain root access.\" That's privilege escalation. So T1404.\n\nAlso \"Exploitation for Initial Access\" could be if attacker uses the backdoor to initially compromise device. But the text says \"could be exploited to gain root access.\" That's privilege escalation after initial access? Not clear. The main technique is privilege escalation.\n\nAlso \"Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts\" (T1398) maybe not. \"Compromise Application Executable\" not. \"Exploitation of Remote Services\" not. So only T1404.\n\nCheck other possible: \"Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism\" is about abusing OS mechanisms to elevate privileges. The backdoor is a kernel backdoor, could be considered abuse of elevation control. But the MITRE technique \"Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism\" is about using OS features to elevate privileges, like sudo, setuid, etc. The kernel backdoor is more direct exploitation. So T1404 is more appropriate.\n\nThus we have one technique: T1404.\n\nProvide reasoning: The backdoor in kernel allows attacker to gain root, which is privilege escalation.\n\nNow final line: \"T1404\". Ensure only IDs, no subtech IDs.\n\nLet's craft answer: list each identified technique with reasoning, then final line.",

Amadey can collect information from compromised hosts and send the data to its C2 servers. To maintain persistence, it overwrites registry keys, changing the Startup folder to the one containing its executable. Amadey is capable of decoding antivirus name strings and searching for folders associated with antivirus software. Additionally, it can download and execute files to further infect the host machine with additional malware.

              "reasoning": "We need to extract MITRE Enterprise attack patterns (techniques) from the text, map to IDs, provide reasoning, and final line only IDs for main techniques (excluding subtechnique IDs). The list includes many IDs, but we need to identify which techniques are described.\n\nText: \"Amadey is a Trojan bot ... communicates with its C2 servers via HTTP and uses fast flux DNS to evade detection. Amadey can collect information from compromised hosts and send the data to its C2 servers. To maintain persistence, it overwrites registry keys, changing the Startup folder to the one containing its executable. Amadey is capable of decoding antivirus name strings and searching for folders associated with antivirus software. Additionally, it can download and execute files to further infect the host machine with additional malware. The Trojan employs various Windows API calls, such as GetComputerNameA, GetUserNameA, and CreateProcessA, and obfuscates strings related to antivirus vendors, domains, and files to avoid detection.\"\n\nIdentify techniques:\n\n- Communicates via HTTP: Application Layer Protocol (T1071) (or maybe \"Web Protocols\"? T1071 is Application Layer Protocol). Also could be \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) but that's exfiltration. It says send data to C2 via HTTP. So both Command and Control using Application Layer Protocol (T1071) and maybe \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041). But we need main technique IDs only, not subtechniques. T1071 is main. T1041 is also main.\n\n- Uses fast flux DNS to evade detection: This is a technique for \"Domain Generation Algorithms\"? Not listed. Fast flux is a DNS technique for C2. Could map to \"Obfuscated Files or Information\"? Not exactly. Could be \"Dynamic Resolution\" (T1568) which is about using DNS to resolve C2. T1568 is \"Dynamic Resolution\". That fits fast flux DNS. So include T1568.\n\n- Collect information from compromised hosts: \"Gather Victim Host Information\" (T1592) maybe. Also \"System Information Discovery\" (T1082). Also \"Account Discovery\" (T1087) maybe not mentioned. It uses GetComputerNameA (system info) and GetUserNameA (user info). So T1082 (System Information Discovery) and T1033 (System Owner/User Discovery) maybe. Also \"Query Registry\" (T1012) for registry keys? Overwrites registry keys for persistence: \"Modify Registry\" (T1112). Also \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" (T1547) for startup folder. Overwrites registry keys to change startup folder: that's \"Modify Registry\" (T1112) and \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" (T1547). Also \"Registry Run Keys/Startup Folder\" is subtechnique of T1547 (T1547.001). But we only list main T1547.\n\n- Decoding antivirus name strings and searching for folders associated with antivirus software: That's \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) for decoding? Actually decoding strings is deobfuscation. Could be \"Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\" (T1140). Also searching for AV folders is \"Defense Evasion\" maybe \"Masquerading\"? Not exactly. Could be \"Hide Artifacts\" (T1564) or \"Impair Defenses\" (1562). But searching for AV is \"Discovery\" of security software: \"Software Discovery\" (T1518) maybe \"Security Software Discovery\" not listed. There's \"Software Discovery\" (T1518). So include T1518.\n\n- Download and execute files: \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1105) for downloading additional malware. Also \"Execution\" via CreateProcessA: \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) maybe not. Could be \"Process Injection\"? Not. So include T1105.\n\n- Obfuscates strings related to antivirus vendors,, and files to avoid detection: \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) and \"Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\" (T1140) for decoding. But we have obfuscation, so T1027.\n\n- Use of Windows API calls: \"Native API\" (T1106) maybe. Also \"Process Discovery\"? Not. So include T1106.\n\n- Persistence via overwriting registry keys and startup folder: Already covered.\n\n- Send data to C2: \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) and \"Data Staged\" (T1074) maybe. But main is T1041.\n\n- Fast flux DNS: T1568.\n\nThus list of techniques identified: T1071, T1041, T1568, T1082, T1033, T1112, T1547, T1518, T1105, T1027, T1106, T1074? maybe not needed. Also \"Data from Local System\" (T1005) for collecting info. Could include T1005.\n\nAlso \"System Owner/User Discovery\" (T1033) is about GetUserNameA. So include.\n\nNow we need to map each to ID and reasoning.\n\nFinally final line: IDs for main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs. So list unique IDs: T1071, T1041, T1568, T1082, T1033, T1112, T1547, T1518, T1105, T1027, T1106, T1005 maybe. Also T1074? Not sure. Let's decide to include T1005 (Data from Local System) because collecting info. Also T1074 (Data Staged) maybe not described. It says send data to C2, not staging. So skip.\n\nThus final line: \"T1071, T1041, T1568, T1082, T1033, T1112, T1547, T1518, T1105, T1027, T1106, T1005\"\n\nNow produce answer with reasoning for each.",

        "8d2c62a63d5564a6483bfb0594c8695a": "We need to extract MITRE Enterprise attack patterns (techniques) from the text, map to IDs, provide reasoning, and final line only IDs for main techniques (excluding subtechnique IDs). The list includes many IDs, but we need to identify which techniques are described.\n\nText: \"Amadey is a Trojan bot ... communicates with its C2 servers via HTTP and uses fast flux DNS to evade detection. Amadey can collect information from compromised hosts and send the data to its C2 servers. To maintain persistence, it overwrites registry keys, changing the Startup folder to the one containing its executable. Amadey is capable of decoding antivirus name strings and searching for folders associated with antivirus software. Additionally, it can download and execute files to further infect the host machine with additional malware. The Trojan employs various Windows API calls, such as GetComputerNameA, GetUserNameA, and CreateProcessA, and obfuscates strings related to antivirus vendors, domains, and files to avoid detection.\"\n\nIdentify techniques:\n\n- Communicates via HTTP: Application Layer Protocol (T1071) (or maybe \"Web Protocols\"? T1071 is Application Layer Protocol). Also could be \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) but that's exfiltration. It says send data to C2 via HTTP. So both Command and Control using Application Layer Protocol (T1071) and maybe \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041). But we need main technique IDs only, not subtechniques. T1071 is main. T1041 is also main.\n\n- Uses fast flux DNS to evade detection: This is a technique for \"Domain Generation Algorithms\"? Not listed. Fast flux is a DNS technique for C2. Could map to \"Obfuscated Files or Information\"? Not exactly. Could be \"Dynamic Resolution\" (T1568) which is about using DNS to resolve C2. T1568 is \"Dynamic Resolution\". That fits fast flux DNS. So include T1568.\n\n- Collect information from compromised hosts: \"Gather Victim Host Information\" (T1592) maybe. Also \"System Information Discovery\" (T1082). Also \"Account Discovery\" (T1087) maybe not mentioned. It uses GetComputerNameA (system info) and GetUserNameA (user info). So T1082 (System Information Discovery) and T1033 (System Owner/User Discovery) maybe. Also \"Query Registry\" (T1012) for registry keys? Overwrites registry keys for persistence: \"Modify Registry\" (T1112). Also \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" (T1547) for startup folder. Overwrites registry keys to change startup folder: that's \"Modify Registry\" (T1112) and \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" (T1547). Also \"Registry Run Keys/Startup Folder\" is subtechnique of T1547 (T1547.001). But we only list main T1547.\n\n- Decoding antivirus name strings and searching for folders associated with antivirus software: That's \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) for decoding? Actually decoding strings is deobfuscation. Could be \"Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\" (T1140). Also searching for AV folders is \"Defense Evasion\" maybe \"Masquerading\"? Not exactly. Could be \"Hide Artifacts\" (T1564) or \"Impair Defenses\" (1562). But searching for AV is \"Discovery\" of security software: \"Software Discovery\" (T1518) maybe \"Security Software Discovery\" not listed. There's \"Software Discovery\" (T1518). So include T1518.\n\n- Download and execute files: \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1105) for downloading additional malware. Also \"Execution\" via CreateProcessA: \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) maybe not. Could be \"Process Injection\"? Not. So include T1105.\n\n- Obfuscates strings related to antivirus vendors,, and files to avoid detection: \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) and \"Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\" (T1140) for decoding. But we have obfuscation, so T1027.\n\n- Use of Windows API calls: \"Native API\" (T1106) maybe. Also \"Process Discovery\"? Not. So include T1106.\n\n- Persistence via overwriting registry keys and startup folder: Already covered.\n\n- Send data to C2: \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) and \"Data Staged\" (T1074) maybe. But main is T1041.\n\n- Fast flux DNS: T1568.\n\nThus list of techniques identified: T1071, T1041, T1568, T1082, T1033, T1112, T1547, T1518, T1105, T1027, T1106, T1074? maybe not needed. Also \"Data from Local System\" (T1005) for collecting info. Could include T1005.\n\nAlso \"System Owner/User Discovery\" (T1033) is about GetUserNameA. So include.\n\nNow we need to map each to ID and reasoning.\n\nFinally final line: IDs for main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs. So list unique IDs: T1071, T1041, T1568, T1082, T1033, T1112, T1547, T1518, T1105, T1027, T1106, T1005 maybe. Also T1074? Not sure. Let's decide to include T1005 (Data from Local System) because collecting info. Also T1074 (Data Staged) maybe not described. It says send data to C2, not staging. So skip.\n\nThus final line: \"T1071, T1041, T1568, T1082, T1033, T1112, T1547, T1518, T1105, T1027, T1106, T1005\"\n\nNow produce answer with reasoning for each.",

                  "reasoning": "We need to extract MITRE Enterprise attack patterns (techniques) from the given text, map to IDs, provide reasoning, and final line only IDs for main techniques (excluding subtechnique IDs). The text mentions:\n\n- \"communicates with its command and control (C2) servers using HTTP, HTTPS, and in some variants, DNS tunneling.\" => Application Layer Protocol (T1071) maybe also \"Protocol Tunneling\" (T1572) or \"DNS Tunneling\" is subtechnique of T1071? Actually T1071 is Application Layer Protocol, subtechniques: T1071.001 Web Protocols, T1071.004 DNS. But we only include main technique ID T1071.\n\n- \"establish persistence by creating a service\" => Create or Modify System Process (T1543) subtechnique \"Windows Service\" (T1543.003). Main ID T1543.\n\n- \"terminating itself if specific execution flags are not present\" maybe \"Execution Guardrails\" (T1480) but that's about preventing execution. Could be \"Impair Defenses\"? Not exactly. Might be \"Self-delete\" but that's \"Indicator Removal\" (T1070) subtechnique \"Delete Files\". Also \"Self-delete\" is \"T1070.004 File Deletion\". Main ID T1070.\n\n- \"uses cmd.exe to execute its self-deletion routine\" => Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059) subtechnique \"Windows Command Shell\". Main ID T1059.\n\n- \"hide files using the NTFS file system.\" => Hide Artifacts (T1564) subtechnique \"Hide Artifacts: NTFS File Attributes\"? Actually T1564.001 \"Hide Artifacts: Hidden Files and Directories\". Main ID T1564.\n\n- \"download additional payloads\" => Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105) maybe also \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" is about downloading. Also \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\"? Not. So T1105.\n\n- \"utilize secondary C2 servers for communication after relaying victim information to the primary C2 servers.\" => Use of fallback C2: \"Fallback Channels\" (T1008). Also \"Command and Control\" but we have Application Layer Protocol already. So T1008.\n\n- \"relay victim information to the primary C2 servers\" => \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) maybe but that's exfil. Could be \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\". However the text says \"relaying victim information to the primary C2 servers\". That's exfiltration. So T1041.\n\n- \"self-delete its dropper\" again T1070.\n\n- \"download additional payloads\" again T1105.\n\n- \"communicates using HTTP, HTTPS\" also \"Web Service\" (T1102) maybe but that's for C2 using web services. However Application Layer Protocol covers.\n\n- \"DNS tunneling\" also \"Protocol Tunneling\" (T1572). Main ID T1572.\n\n- \"creating a service\" also \"Service Stop\"? No.\n\n- \"self\" also \"Indicator Removal\" (T1070).\n\n- \"hide files using NTFS file system\" also \"Obfuscated Files or Information\"? Not.\n\nThus list of main technique IDs: T1071, T1543, T1070, T1059, T1564, T1105, T1008, T1041, T1572.\n\nCheck if any other: \"establish persistence\" also \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" (T1547) but service is T1543.

The text mentions:\n\n- \"communicates with its command and control (C2) servers using HTTP, HTTPS, and in some variants, DNS tunneling.\" => Application Layer Protocol (T1071) maybe also \"Protocol Tunneling\" (T1572) or \"DNS Tunneling\" is subtechnique of T1071? Actually T1071 is Application Layer Protocol, subtechniques: T1071.001 Web Protocols, T1071.004 DNS. But we only include main technique ID T1071.\n\n- \"establish persistence by creating a service\" => Create or Modify System Process (T1543) subtechnique \"Windows Service\" (T1543.003). Main ID T1543.\n\n- \"terminating itself if specific execution flags are not present\" maybe \"Execution Guardrails\" (T1480) but that's about preventing execution. Could be \"Impair Defenses\"? Not exactly. Might be \"Self-delete\" but that's \"Indicator Removal\" (T1070) subtechnique \"Delete Files\". Also \"Self-delete\" is \"T1070.004 File Deletion\". Main ID T1070.\n\n- \"uses cmd.exe to execute its self-deletion routine\" => Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059) subtechnique \"Windows Command Shell\". Main ID T1059.\n\n- \"hide files using the NTFS file system.\" => Hide Artifacts (T1564) subtechnique \"Hide Artifacts: NTFS File Attributes\"? Actually T1564.001 \"Hide Artifacts: Hidden Files and Directories\". Main ID T1564.\n\n- \"download additional payloads\" => Ingress Tool Transfer (T1105) maybe also \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" is about downloading. Also \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\"? Not. So T1105.\n\n- \"utilize secondary C2 servers for communication after relaying victim information to the primary C2 servers.\" => Use of fallback C2: \"Fallback Channels\" (T1008). Also \"Command and Control\" but we have Application Layer Protocol already. So T1008.\n\n- \"relay victim information to the primary C2 servers\" => \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) maybe but that's exfil. Could be \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\". However the text says \"relaying victim information to the primary C2 servers\". That's exfiltration. So T1041.\n\n- \"self-delete its dropper\" again T1070.\n\n- \"download additional payloads\" again T1105.\n\n- \"communicates using HTTP, HTTPS\" also \"Web Service\" (T1102) maybe but that's for C2 using web services. However Application Layer Protocol covers.\n\n- \"DNS tunneling\" also \"Protocol Tunneling\" (T1572). Main ID T1572.\n\n- \"creating a service\" also \"Service Stop\"? No.\n\n- \"self\" also \"Indicator Removal\" (T1070).\n\n- \"hide files using NTFS file system\" also \"Obfuscated Files or Information\"? Not.\n\nThus list of main technique IDs: T1071, T1543, T1070, T1059, T1564, T1105, T1008, T1041, T1572.\n\nCheck if any other: \"establish persistence\" also \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" (T1547) but service is T1543.

It communicates with its command and control (C2) server via HTTP and registers to receive the BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast intent, allowing it to activate upon device startup. The adware generates revenue by automatically displaying ads. To avoid detection, Android/AdDisplay.Ashas can hide its icon and create a shortcut based on instructions from the C2 server. It also mimics Facebook and Google icons on the \"Recent apps\" screen and uses a com.google.xxx package name to further evade identification. The C2 server address is concealed using base-64 encoding. Additionally, Android/AdDisplay.Ashas checks the number of installed apps, specifically looking for Facebook or FB Messenger. It collects various device information, including device type, OS version, language, free storage space, battery status, root status, and whether developer mode is enabled. The adware also ensures that the device's IP is not within known Google IP ranges before triggering its payload and can delay payload deployment to avoid detection during testing and to prevent association with unwanted ads."

Final line only IDs for main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs. The list includes IDs and names. Need to identify which techniques are described in the text.\n\nText: Android/Chuli.A distributed via spearphishing email with attachment -> that's Phishing (T1660). Also \"spearphishing email that contained an attachment\" is a phishing technique.\n\nMalware utilized HTTP uploads to a specific URL as its command and control mechanism. That's \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1646) maybe also \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1541?) Actually \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" is T1541? Wait list shows T1541: Foreground Persistence. Not that. In list, \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" is T1541? No, T1541 is Foreground Persistence. In list, \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" is T1541? Actually they have T1541: Foreground Persistence. So Ingress Tool Transfer is not listed. However \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" is a technique but not in list. Maybe \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" is T1541? But they gave T1541 as Foreground Persistence, so maybe they omitted Ingress Tool Transfer. However \"HTTP uploads to a specific URL as its command and control mechanism\" could be \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1646) or \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\"? Not. Also \"Generate Traffic from Victim\" (T1643) maybe.\n\nStealing geo-location info -> Location Tracking (T1430). Call logs -> Call Control (T1616) maybe also \"Credentials from Password Store\"? No. Contact lists -> maybe \"Steal Application Access Token\"? Not. SMS message content -> SMS Control (T1582). Also \"used SMS to receive command and control messages\" -> SMS Control (T1582) again.\n\nGather system information: phone number, OS version, phone model, SDK version -> System Information Discovery (T1426). Also \"Phone number\" maybe \"System Information Discovery\". Also \"Network Service Scanning\"? Not.\n\nThus identified techniques:\n\n- Phishing (T1660)\n- Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1646) or Generate Traffic from Victim (T1643). Which is more appropriate? The text says \"utilized HTTP uploads to a specific URL as its command and control mechanism.\" That's C2 channel usage, not exfiltration. Could be \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\"? No. There's \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" not present. \"Generate Traffic from Victim\" (T1643) is about generating traffic to C2. So we can map to T1643.\n\n- Location Tracking (T1430)\n- Call Control (T1616)\n- SMS Control (T1582)\n- System Information Discovery (T1426)\n\nAlso \"stealing various forms of sensitive data\" includes contact lists, call logs, SMS content. Could be \"Data from Local System\" (T1533) maybe. But list includes T1533: Data from Local System. That is about collecting data. So we could include that.\n\nAlso \"stealing various forms of sensitive data\" could be \"Data from Local System\" (T1533). Also \"Data Manipulation\"? Not.\n\nThus main techniques: T1660, T1643, T1430, T1616, T1582, T1426, T1533.\n\nWe need to provide reasoning for each identification.\n\nFinal line: IDs separated by commas, only main techniques, exclude subtechnique IDs (none here). So list: T1660, T1643, T1430, T1616, T1582, T1426, T1533\n\nCheck if any other technique: \"HTTP uploads\" could be \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" but not in list. \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" not described. \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1437) maybe because using HTTP? Could be. But the text says \"utilized HTTP uploads to a specific URL as its command and control mechanism.\" That's using application layer protocol (HTTP). So we could also map to T1437. However we already have T1643 for generate traffic. Might include both. The question: \"Extract all MITRE Mobile attack patterns from the following text and map them to their corresponding MITRE technique IDs.\" So we should include all that apply. So include T1437 as well.\n\nThus list expands: T1660, T1643, T1437, T1430, T1616, T1582, T1426, T1533\n\nCheck if any other: \"Stealing various forms of sensitive data\" could be \"Data from Local System\" (T1533). Also \"Data Manipulation\" not. \"Data Encrypted for Impact\" not.\n\nThus final IDs line: T1660, T1643, T1437, T1430, T1616, T1582, T1426, T1533\n\nProvide reasoning for each.\n\nNow produce answer.",

In list, \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" is T1541? No, T1541 is Foreground Persistence. In list, \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" is T1541? Actually they have T1541: Foreground Persistence. So Ingress Tool Transfer is not listed. However \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" is a technique but not in list. Maybe \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" is T1541? But they gave T1541 as Foreground Persistence, so maybe they omitted Ingress Tool Transfer. However \"HTTP uploads to a specific URL as its command and control mechanism\" could be \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1646) or \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\"? Not. Also \"Generate Traffic from Victim\" (T1643) maybe.\n\nStealing geo-location info -> Location Tracking (T1430). Call logs -> Call Control (T1616) maybe also \"Credentials from Password Store\"? No. Contact lists -> maybe \"Steal Application Access Token\"? Not. SMS message content -> SMS Control (T1582). Also \"used SMS to receive command and control messages\" -> SMS Control (T1582) again.\n\nGather system information: phone number, OS version, phone model, SDK version -> System Information Discovery (T1426). Also \"Phone number\" maybe \"System Information Discovery\". Also \"Network Service Scanning\"? Not.\n\nThus identified techniques:\n\n- Phishing (T1660)\n- Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1646) or Generate Traffic from Victim (T1643). Which is more appropriate? The text says \"utilized HTTP uploads to a specific URL as its command and control mechanism.\" That's C2 channel usage, not exfiltration. Could be \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\"? No. There's \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" not present. \"Generate Traffic from Victim\" (T1643) is about generating traffic to C2. So we can map to T1643.\n\n- Location Tracking (T1430)\n- Call Control (T1616)\n- SMS Control (T1582)\n- System Information Discovery (T1426)\n\nAlso \"stealing various forms of sensitive data\" includes contact lists, call logs, SMS content. Could be \"Data from Local System\" (T1533) maybe. But list includes T1533: Data from Local System. That is about collecting data. So we could include that.\n\nAlso \"stealing various forms of sensitive data\" could be \"Data from Local System\" (T1533). Also \"Data Manipulation\"? Not.\n\nThus main techniques: T1660, T1643, T1430, T1616, T1582, T1426, T1533.\n\nWe need to provide reasoning for each identification.\n\nFinal line: IDs separated by commas, only main techniques, exclude subtechnique IDs (none here). So list: T1660, T1643, T1430, T1616, T1582, T1426, T1533\n\nCheck if any other technique: \"HTTP uploads\" could be \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" but not in list. \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" not described. \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1437) maybe because using HTTP? Could be. But the text says \"utilized HTTP uploads to a specific URL as its command and control mechanism.\" That's using application layer protocol (HTTP). So we could also map to T1437. However we already have T1643 for generate traffic. Might include both. The question: \"Extract all MITRE Mobile attack patterns from the following text and map them to their corresponding MITRE technique IDs.\" So we should include all that apply. So include T1437 as well.\n\nThus list expands: T1660, T1643, T1437, T1430, T1616, T1582, T1426, T1533\n\nCheck if any other: \"Stealing various forms of sensitive data\" could be \"Data from Local System\" (T1533). Also \"Data Manipulation\" not. \"Data Encrypted for Impact\" not.\n\nThus final IDs line: T1660, T1643, T1437, T1430, T1616, T1582, T1426, T1533\n\nProvide reasoning for each.\n\nNow produce answer.",

Final line only IDs for main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs. The list includes IDs and names. Need to identify which techniques are described in the text.\n\nText: Android/Chuli.A distributed via spearphishing email with attachment -> that's Phishing (T1660). Also \"spearphishing email that contained an attachment\" is a phishing technique.\n\nMalware utilized HTTP uploads to a specific URL as its command and control mechanism. That's \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1646) maybe also \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1541?) Actually \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" is T1541? Wait list shows T1541: Foreground Persistence. Not that. In list, \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" is T1541? No, T1541 is Foreground Persistence. In list, \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" is T1541? Actually they have T1541: Foreground Persistence. So Ingress Tool Transfer is not listed. However \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" is a technique but not in list. Maybe \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" is T1541? But they gave T1541 as Foreground Persistence, so maybe they omitted Ingress Tool Transfer. However \"HTTP uploads to a specific URL as its command and control mechanism\" could be \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1646) or \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\"? Not. Also \"Generate Traffic from Victim\" (T1643) maybe.\n\nStealing geo-location info -> Location Tracking (T1430). Call logs -> Call Control (T1616) maybe also \"Credentials from Password Store\"? No. Contact lists -> maybe \"Steal Application Access Token\"? Not. SMS message content -> SMS Control (T1582). Also \"used SMS to receive command and control messages\" -> SMS Control (T1582) again.\n\nGather system information: phone number, OS version, phone model, SDK version -> System Information Discovery (T1426). Also \"Phone number\" maybe \"System Information Discovery\". Also \"Network Service Scanning\"? Not.\n\nThus identified techniques:\n\n- Phishing (T1660)\n- Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1646) or Generate Traffic from Victim (T1643). Which is more appropriate? The text says \"utilized HTTP uploads to a specific URL as its command and control mechanism.\" That's C2 channel usage, not exfiltration. Could be \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\"? No. There's \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" not present. \"Generate Traffic from Victim\" (T1643) is about generating traffic to C2. So we can map to T1643.\n\n- Location Tracking (T1430)\n- Call Control (T1616)\n- SMS Control (T1582)\n- System Information Discovery (T1426)\n\nAlso \"stealing various forms of sensitive data\" includes contact lists, call logs, SMS content. Could be \"Data from Local System\" (T1533) maybe. But list includes T1533: Data from Local System. That is about collecting data. So we could include that.\n\nAlso \"stealing various forms of sensitive data\" could be \"Data from Local System\" (T1533). Also \"Data Manipulation\"? Not.\n\nThus main techniques: T1660, T1643, T1430, T1616, T1582, T1426, T1533.\n\nWe need to provide reasoning for each identification.\n\nFinal line: IDs separated by commas, only main techniques, exclude subtechnique IDs (none here). So list: T1660, T1643, T1430, T1616, T1582, T1426, T1533\n\nCheck if any other technique: \"HTTP uploads\" could be \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" but not in list. \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" not described. \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1437) maybe because using HTTP? Could be. But the text says \"utilized HTTP uploads to a specific URL as its command and control mechanism.\" That's using application layer protocol (HTTP). So we could also map to T1437. However we already have T1643 for generate traffic. Might include both. The question: \"Extract all MITRE Mobile attack patterns from the following text and map them to their corresponding MITRE technique IDs.\" So we should include all that apply. So include T1437 as well.\n\nThus list expands: T1660, T1643, T1437, T1430, T1616, T1582, T1426, T1533\n\nCheck if any other: \"Stealing various forms of sensitive data\" could be \"Data from Local System\" (T1533). Also \"Data Manipulation\" not. \"Data Encrypted for Impact\" not.\n\nThus final IDs line: T1660, T1643, T1437, T1430, T1616, T1582, T1426, T1533\n\nProvide reasoning for each.\n\nNow produce answer.",

That's \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1406).\n\n- Stores encrypted payload code in Assets directory and uses custom decryption routine that assembles a .dex file by passing data through Android Intent objects. That's \"Encrypted Channel\"? Not. Storing encrypted payload is \"Data Encrypted for Impact\" (T1471) maybe? Actually that's about encrypting victim data. Here it's encrypting malicious payload for concealment. Could be \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" again. Also \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1544) for downloading new code at runtime? It assembles .dex file via intents, that's \"Dynamic Resolution\" (T1637) maybe? Actually dynamic resolution is about resolving code at runtime. Could be \"Download New Code at Runtime\" (T1407). But they store encrypted payload locally, not download. So maybe \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" covers.\n\n- Also \"Compromise Application Executable\" (T1577) maybe because they embed malicious .dex in assets. But that's about compromising app executable. Could be \"Compromise Application Executable\".\n\n- Also \"Access Notifications\" (T1517) maybe because they use notifications to display ransom note. That's about accessing notifications. The technique is \"Access Notifications\". They display a notification screen. So T1517.\n\n- \"Screen Capture\" (T1513) not present.\n\n- \"Call Control\" maybe not.\n\n- \"Data Destruction\" (T1662) not.\n\n- \"Data Manipulation\" (T1641) not.\n\n- \"Endpoint Denial of Service\" not.\n\n- \"Hijack Execution Flow\" (T1625) maybe because they override callbacks to hijack flow.

Event Triggered Execution (T1624) – broadcast intents trigger payload.\n3. Masquerading (T1655) – disguises as popular apps.\n4. Obfuscated Files or Information (T1406) – name mangling, meaningless variable names.\n5. Access Notifications (T1517) – uses notification screen to block UI.\n6. Hijack Execution Flow (T1625) – overriding callbacks to generate new notification.\n7. Compromise Application Executable (T1577) – stores malicious .dex in assets and assembles at runtime.\n8. Possibly Dynamic Resolution (T1637) – passing data through intents to assemble code.\n9. Possibly Download New Code at Runtime (T1407) – but not downloading, just assembling.\n\nWe need to ensure each is actually in list. All IDs present.\n\nNow produce reasoning for each.\n\nFinally final line: list IDs for main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs (none). Should we include all identified? Probably yes.\n\nThus final line: T1541, T1624, T1655, T1406, T1517, T1625, T1577, T1637\n\nCheck if any duplicates.\n\nNow craft answer.",

Provide reasoning for each identification. Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Mobile IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** AndroidOS/MalLocker.B is a variant of a ransomware family that targets Android devices by blocking user interaction with the UI through a screen displaying a ransom note over all other windows. This malware registers to receive 14 different broadcast intents, allowing it to automatically trigger its malicious payloads. It can further disrupt user interaction by using a carefully designed \"call\" notification screen, combined with overriding the onUserLeaveHint() callback method to generate a new notification when the current one is dismissed.

Then final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. The list provided includes only main technique IDs (no subtechnique). So we need to identify which techniques are described.\n\nText summary:\n\n- Ransomware blocks user interaction with UI via ransom note over all windows. That's \"Foreground Persistence\" (T1541) maybe? Actually \"Foreground Persistence\" is about keeping UI visible. Could also be \"Impair Defenses\"? Not. There's also \"Screen Capture\" etc. But blocking UI is a form of \"Impair Defenses\"? Not. MITRE Mobile technique \"Foreground Persistence\" is about maintaining presence in foreground. So T1541.\n\n- Registers to receive 14 broadcast intents, allowing automatic trigger of malicious payloads. That's \"Event Triggered Execution\" (T1624) - using broadcast intents as triggers.\n\n- Uses call notification screen, overriding onUserLeaveHint() to generate new notification when dismissed. That's also \"Event Triggered Execution\" maybe \"Call Control\" (T1616) but call notification screen is about UI. Could be \"Call Control\" is about controlling phone calls. Not. Overriding callback to generate notification is still event triggered.\n\n- Disguises as popular apps, cracked games, video players. That's \"Masquerading\" (T1655).\n\n- Name mangling and meaningless variable names to evade detection. That's \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1406).\n\n- Stores encrypted payload code in Assets directory and uses custom decryption routine that assembles a .dex file by passing data through Android Intent objects. That's \"Encrypted Channel\"? Not. Storing encrypted payload is \"Data Encrypted for Impact\" (T1471) maybe? Actually that's about encrypting victim data. Here it's encrypting malicious payload for concealment. Could be \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" again. Also \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1544) for downloading new code at runtime? It assembles .dex file via intents, that's \"Dynamic Resolution\" (T1637) maybe? Actually dynamic resolution is about resolving code at runtime. Could be \"Download New Code at Runtime\" (T1407). But they store encrypted payload locally, not download. So maybe \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" covers.\n\n- Also \"Compromise Application Executable\" (T1577) maybe because they embed malicious .dex in assets. But that's about compromising app executable. Could be \"Compromise Application Executable\".\n\n- Also \"Access Notifications\" (T1517) maybe because they use notifications to display ransom note. That's about accessing notifications. The technique is \"Access Notifications\". They display a notification screen. So T1517.\n\n- \"Screen Capture\" (T1513) not present.\n\n- \"Call Control\" maybe not.\n\n- \"Data Destruction\" (T1662) not.\n\n- \"Data Manipulation\" (T1641) not.\n\n- \"Endpoint Denial of Service\" not.\n\n- \"Hijack Execution Flow\" (T1625) maybe because they override callbacks to hijack flow. Could be.\n\n- \"Hooking\" (T1617) also about hooking system calls. Overriding onUserLeaveHint is hooking? Might be considered hooking.\n\nWe need to map each identified pattern to ID.\n\nLet's list likely techniques:\n\n1. Foreground Persistence (T1541) – ransom note over UI.\n2. Event Triggered Execution (T1624) – broadcast intents trigger payload.\n3. Masquerading (T1655) – disguises as popular apps.\n4. Obfuscated Files or Information (T1406) – name mangling, meaningless variable names.\n5. Access Notifications (T1517) – uses notification screen to block UI.\n6. Hijack Execution Flow (T1625) – overriding callbacks to generate new notification.\n7. Compromise Application Executable (T1577) – stores malicious .dex in assets and assembles at runtime.\n8. Possibly Dynamic Resolution (T1637) – passing data through intents to assemble code.\n9. Possibly Download New Code at Runtime (T1407) – but not downloading, just assembling.\n\nWe need to ensure each is actually in list. All IDs present.\n\nNow produce reasoning for each.\n\nFinally final line: list IDs for main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs (none). Should we include all identified? Probably yes.\n\nThus final line: T1541, T1624, T1655, T1406, T1517, T1625, T1577, T1637\n\nCheck if any duplicates.\n\nNow craft answer.",

The list provided includes IDs and names. Need to identify which techniques are described in the text.\n\nText: \"ANDROIDOS_ANSERVER.A is a distinctive Android malware known for utilizing encrypted content hosted on a blog site as part of its command and control strategy. This malware collects various device-specific information, including the OS version, build version, manufacturer, model, IMEI, and IMSI. The encrypted content within the blog site contains URLs that direct the malware to additional servers for further command and control activities.\"\n\nSo techniques:\n\n- Collect device-specific information: OS version, build version, manufacturer, model, IMEI, IMSI. That's system information discovery. The relevant MITRE Mobile technique: \"System Information Discovery\" (ID T1426). Also maybe \"Device Identifier\" but not listed. So T1426.\n\n- Utilizes encrypted content hosted on a blog site as part of its command and control strategy. Encrypted content: \"Encrypted Channel\" (T1521) maybe? Actually encrypted content is used for C2, but the technique is \"Encrypted Channel\" (T1521). Also \"Download New Code at Runtime\" (T1407) because it fetches URLs to additional servers. Could be \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1544) for downloading additional code. Also \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1406) for encrypted content. Also \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" maybe not. The text mentions \"encrypted content hosted on a blog site\" - that's obfuscation. So T1406.\n\n- The URLs direct to additional servers for further command and control activities: That's \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\"? Not exactly. Could be \"C2 over Web Service\" but not in list. There's \"Web Service\" (T1481) maybe for using blog site as C2. So T1481.\n\n- Also \"Network Service Scanning\"? Not described.\n\n- \"Data Encrypted for Impact\"? Not.\n\nThus main techniques: System Information Discovery (T1426), Obfuscated Files or Information (T1406), Web Service (T1481). Possibly also \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1544) for downloading new code. Also \"Encrypted Channel\" (T1521). Need to decide which are most directly described.\n\nThe text: \"utilizing encrypted content hosted on a blog site as part of its command and control strategy.\" That is using encrypted content for C2, which is \"Encrypted Channel\" (T1521) or \"Obfuscated Files or Information\". Encrypted content is stored on blog site, not necessarily channel encryption. Could be both. But we need to map each identified pattern to ID.\n\nLet's list:\n\n1. Collect device-specific info -> System Information Discovery (T1426)\n2. Encrypted content hosted on blog site -> Obfuscated Files or Information (T1406) (since content is encrypted)\n3. Encrypted content used for C2 -> Encrypted Channel (T1521) (maybe)\n4. URLs to additional servers for further C2 -> Web Service (T1481) (using blog site as web service)\n5. Download new code at runtime -> Download New Code at Runtime (T1407) or Ingress Tool Transfer (T1544). The text says \"directs the malware to additional servers for further command and control activities.\" Not explicitly downloading code, but could be retrieving commands. Might be \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\"? Not.\n\nBetter to include only those clearly indicated. The question: \"Extract all MITRE Mobile attack patterns from the following text and map them to their corresponding MITRE technique IDs.\" So we need to list all that apply. So we can include multiple.\n\nThus we will produce a list with reasoning for each.\n\nFinally, final line: only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. All IDs are main (no subtech). So we list IDs: T1426, T1406, T1521, T1481, T1407 maybe, T1544 maybe. Need to decide which are main.\n\nLet's include T1426, T1406, T1521, T1481, T1407, T1544. That's six IDs.\n\nNow produce answer with reasoning and final line.",

MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** ANDROMEDA is a widely recognized commodity malware that was prevalent in the early 2010s and continues to be detected in various industries. During the 2022 C0026 campaign, threat actors re-registered expired ANDROMEDA command and control (C2) domains to deliver malware to targeted entities in Ukraine. ANDROMEDA possesses the capability to make GET requests to download files from its C2 server and can establish persistence by copying itself to `C:\\ProgramData\\Local Settings\\Temp\\mskmde.com` and creating a Registry run key to ensure it executes at each user logon. It can also download additional payloads from its C2 server. The malware has been observed installing itself to `C:\\Temp\\TrustedInstaller.exe`, masquerading as a legitimate Windows installer service, and has been delivered through LNK files disguised as folders. ANDROMEDA can inject itself into the `wuauclt.exe` process to execute C2 commands and has also been spread via infected USB drives.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 :

Provide reasoning for each identification. Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** ANDROMEDA is a widely recognized commodity malware that was prevalent in the early 2010s and continues to be detected in various industries. During the 2022 C0026 campaign, threat actors re-registered expired ANDROMEDA command and control (C2) domains to deliver malware to targeted entities in Ukraine. ANDROMEDA possesses the capability to make GET requests to download files from its C2 server and can establish persistence by copying itself to `C:\\ProgramData\\Local Settings\\Temp\\mskmde.com` and creating a Registry run key to ensure it executes at each user logon. It can also download additional payloads from its C2 server. The malware has been observed installing itself to `C:\\Temp\\TrustedInstaller.exe`, masquerading as a legitimate Windows installer service, and has been delivered through LNK files disguised as folders. ANDROMEDA can inject itself into the `wuauclt.exe` process to execute C2 commands and has also been spread via infected USB drives.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 :

During the 2022 C0026 campaign, threat actors re-registered expired ANDROMEDA command and control (C2) domains to deliver malware to targeted entities in Ukraine. ANDROMEDA possesses the capability to make GET requests to download files from its C2 server and can establish persistence by copying itself to `C:\\ProgramData\\Local Settings\\Temp\\mskmde.com` and creating a Registry run key to ensure it executes at each user logon. It can also download additional payloads from its C2 server. The malware has been observed installing itself to `C:\\Temp\\TrustedInstaller.exe`, masquerading as a legitimate Windows installer service, and has been delivered through LNK files disguised as folders. ANDROMEDA can inject itself into the `wuauclt.exe` process to execute C2 commands and has also been spread via infected USB drives.",
        "9ab2c1a8f0fd84866f39e3c4065e38d5": "We need to extract MITRE Enterprise attack patterns (techniques) from the text, map to IDs, provide reasoning, and final line only IDs for main techniques (excluding subtechnique IDs). The text describes:\n\n- Re-register expired C2 domains to deliver malware: This is \"Acquire Infrastructure\" (T1584) maybe \"Compromise Infrastructure\" (T1584) or \"Acquire Infrastructure\" (T1583). Actually re-registering domains is \"Acquire Infrastructure\" (T1583) or \"Compromise Infrastructure\" (T1584). The description: \"re-registered expired ANDROMEDA command and control (C2) domains\" - that's acquiring infrastructure (domains). So T1583 (Acquire Infrastructure) or T1584 (Compromise Infrastructure). Which is more appropriate? Re-registering expired domain is acquiring new domain, not compromising existing. So T1583.\n\n- Make GET requests to download files from C2 server: This is \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1105) or \"Command and Control\" but technique is \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" for downloading additional payloads. Also \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" is not. So T1105.\n\n- Persistence by copying itself to C:\\ProgramData\\Local Settings\\Temp\\mskmde.com and creating a Registry run key to ensure it executes at each user logon: This is \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" (T1547) subtechnique \"Registry Run Keys/Startup Folder\" (T1547.001). Main technique T1547.\n\n- Installing itself to C:\\Temp\\TrustedInstaller.exe, masquerading as legitimate Windows installer service: This is \"Masquerading\" (T1036). Also \"Install Service\"? Not in list. So T1036.\n\n- Delivered through LNK files disguised as folders: This is \"LNK files\" is a form of \"Shortcut Modification\" which is T1023? Not in list. Could be \"User Execution\" (T1204) because user clicks LNK. But the technique \"Masquerading\" also covers disguised files. So T1036.\n\n- Inject itself into wuauclt.exe process to execute C2 commands: This is \"Process Injection\" (T1055).\n\n- Spread via infected USB drives: This is \"Replication Through Removable Media\" (T1091) or \"Exfiltration Over Physical Medium\"? Actually spread via USB is \"Replication Through Removable Media\" (T1091). Also \"Removable Media\" is T1025 for data from removable media, but for propagation it's T1091.\n\n- Also \"Command and Control\" using GET requests: maybe \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) but not needed.\n\n- Also \"Create Registry run key\" is \"Modify Registry\" (T1112) but main persistence is T1547.\n\nThus list of main techniques: T1583, T1105, T1547, T1036, T1055, T1091.\n\nCheck if any other: \"C2 domains\" also \"Domain Registration\" is \"Acquire Infrastructure\". Good.\n\nNow we need to provide reasoning for each identification.\n\nFinally final line: IDs separated by commas, no subtechnique IDs. So \"T1583, T1105, T1547, T1036, T1055, T1091\".\n\nMake sure ordering maybe as identified.\n\nNow produce answer.",

So we just need to list IDs that correspond to techniques mentioned in the text.\n\nText mentions: collecting device location, call logs, sending SMS, capturing photos, gathering audio from microphone, making phone calls, track location via GPS or network settings, disguises as legitimate applications, send SMS, collect call logs, capture photos and videos using cameras.\n\nCorresponding MITRE Mobile techniques:\n\n- Location Tracking (T1430) – for device location via GPS/network.\n- Call Control (T1616) – making phone calls? Actually \"Call Control\" is about controlling calls, maybe includes making calls. Also \"Call logs\" could be \"Credentials from Password Store\"? No. There's \"Call Control\" for phone call actions. Also \"SMS Control\" (T1582) for sending SMS messages.\n- Audio Capture (T1429) – gathering audio from microphone.\n- Screen Capture (T1513) – capturing photos? Actually screen capture is screenshot; but capturing photos via camera is \"Video Capture\" (T1512) or maybe \"Screen Capture\"? There's \"Video Capture\" for video; \"Photo Capture\" not listed but maybe \"Screen Capture\" covers it? There's also \"Video Capture\" (T1512) for video; photos maybe \"Screen Capture\"? Not perfect but we can map to \"Screen Capture\" for capturing photos? However there is \"Video Capture\" for video. So we can include both T1512 and T1513? The text says capture photos and videos using cameras. So Video Capture (T1512) is appropriate. Photo capture maybe not in list; but we could map to \"Screen Capture\" (T1513) as generic capture of visual data. Might be okay.\n\n- Call logs: maybe \"Credentials from Password Store\"? No. There's \"Call Control\" but logs? Not sure. Could be \"Data from Local System\" (T1533) for collecting logs. But the list includes \"Data from Local System\" (T1533). That could be generic data collection. However we should map only specific techniques that match. The text mentions \"collecting various types of data, including device location and call logs\". That is data collection; could be \"Data from Local System\" (T1533). Also \"Audio Capture\" is specific.\n\n- Masquerading (T1655) – disguises as legitimate applications.\n\n- Remote Access Software (T1663) – AndroRAT is a remote access tool.\n\n- Possibly \"Compromise Application Executable\" (T1577) – if the tool is installed via malicious app? Not directly mentioned.\n\n- \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1646) maybe not mentioned.\n\n- \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1623) not mentioned.\n\n- \"Network Service Scanning\" not.\n\n- \"Process Discovery\" not.\n\n- \"System Information Discovery\" maybe not.\n\nThus main techniques: T1430, T1616, T1582, T1429, T1512, T1513 (maybe), T1533, T1655, T1663.\n\nCheck each ID exists in list: T1430 Location Tracking, T1616 Call Control, T1582 SMS Control, T1429 Audio Capture, T1512 Video Capture, T1513 Screen Capture, T1533 Data from Local System, T1655 Masquerading, T1663 Remote Access Software.\n\nNow reasoning for each.\n\nFinally final line: list IDs separated by commas, only main techniques, no subtechnique IDs (none). So output line: T1430, T1616, T1582, T1429, T1512, T1513, T1533, T1655, T1663\n\nWe should ensure ordering maybe alphabetical or as identified. Provide reasoning paragraphs then final line.\n\n",

Then final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. The list provided includes only main technique IDs (no subtechnique). So we need to match descriptions in text to technique names.\n\nText summary:\n\n- Anubis is Android malware, espionage, banking trojan.\n- Capable of exfiltrating data encrypted with RC4 via ransomware module and can also record phone calls and audio, as well as make phone calls.\n- Ransomware module encrypts device data and hold it for ransom, while also exfiltrating encrypted files.\n- Modify external storage and download attacker-specified APK files.\n- To resist uninstallation, exploits Android performGlobalAction(int) API call.\n- Keylogger functions across all applications, can track GPS location.\n- Requested accessibility service privileges while masquerading as \"Google Play Protect\".\n- Disguised additional malicious application installations as legitimate system updates.\n\nNow map to MITRE Mobile technique IDs list.\n\nLet's list relevant techniques:\n\n- Record phone calls and audio: Audio Capture (T1429). Also Call Control (T1616) maybe for making phone calls? \"make phone calls\" could be Call Control (T1616) which is about controlling phone calls. Also \"record phone calls\" could be Audio Capture (T1429) or maybe \"Call Control\" includes intercepting calls. We'll include both.\n\n- Exfiltrating data encrypted with RC4: Data Encrypted for Impact (T1471) maybe? Actually Data Encrypted for Impact is about encrypting data for impact (ransomware). Also \"Encrypted Channel\" (T1521) is about encrypting exfiltration channel. But they encrypt data before exfil, not channel. So Data Encrypted for Impact (T1471) matches.\n\n- Modify external storage: Data Manipulation (T1641) maybe? Or \"Modify external storage\" could be \"Data Manipulation\". Also \"File and Directory Discovery\" not relevant. \"Modify external storage\" could be \"Data Manipulation\". Also \"Archive Collected Data\" not.\n\n- Download attacker-specified APK files: Download New Code at Runtime (T1407). Also \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1544) is about transferring tools. But downloading APK is new code. So T1407.\n\n- Resist uninstallation, exploits Android performGlobalAction(int) API call: This is about \"Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\" maybe? Actually performGlobalAction is a privileged API to perform actions like uninstall? Could be \"Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\" (T1404). Or \"Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism\" (T1626). The technique list includes T1626: Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism. That seems appropriate: using privileged API to prevent uninstall. So T1626.\n\n- Keylogger across all applications: Input Capture (T1417) maybe? Actually Input Capture is about capturing keystrokes. There's also \"Keylogging\" but not listed. Input Capture (T1417) is correct.\n\n- Track GPS location: Location Tracking (T1430).\n\n- Requested accessibility service privileges while masquerading as \"Google Play Protect\": This is about \"Masquerading\" (T1655). Also \"Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism\"? Accessibility service is a privileged permission. Could be \"Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism\" again. But we already have that. Also \"Subvert Trust Controls\" (T1632) maybe? Using accessibility service to bypass security. But we can map to \"Masquerading\" (T1655) for pretending to be Google Play Protect.\n\n- Disguised malicious app installations as legitimate system updates: Masquerading (T1655) again, also \"Compromise Application Executable\" (T1577) maybe? Installing malicious apps disguised as updates is a form of \"Compromise Application Executable\". But the list includes T1577: Compromise Application Executable. That could be relevant.\n\n- \"Make phone calls\": Call Control (T1616) maybe.\n\n- \"Exfiltrating encrypted files\": Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1646) maybe? Or Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1639). The text says exfiltrating encrypted files from the device. Could be generic exfiltration. The list includes T1646: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. We'll include that.\n\n- \"Modify external storage\": Data Manipulation (T1641) as earlier.\n\n- \"Ransomware module encrypts device data and hold it for ransom\": Data Encrypted for Impact (T1471) and Data Destruction (T1662) maybe? Not destruction, just encryption.\n\n- \"Resist uninstallation\": Hide Artifacts (T1628) maybe? Hide Artifacts is about hiding presence. Resist uninstall could be Hide Artifacts. Also \"Impair Defenses\" (T1629) maybe. But we already have Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism. Could also be \"Impair Defenses\". However we need to map to technique IDs from list. Hide Artifacts (T1628) seems plausible.\n\n- \"Download attacker-specified APK files\": Ingress Tool Transfer (T1544) also relevant. But we already have Download New Code at Runtime (T1407). Could include both.\n\n- \"Keylogger across all applications\": Input Capture (T1417) and maybe \"Hooking\" (T1617) because hooking into all apps. Hooking is about intercepting API calls. Could be.\n\n- \"Record phone calls\": Audio Capture (T1429) as earlier.\n\n- \"Make phone calls\": Call Control (T1616).\n\n- \"Track GPS location\": Location Tracking (T1430).\n\n- \"Requested accessibility service privileges\": Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (T1626) again.\n\n- \"Masquerading as Google Play Protect\": Masquerading (T1655).\n\n- \"Disguised malicious app installations as legitimate system updates\": Masquerading (T1655) and maybe \"Compromise Application Executable\" (T1577) or \"Compromise Client Software Binary\" (T1645). The latter is about compromising client software binary. Installing malicious APK could be that. But we already have Download New Code.\n\nNow we need to list all identified techniques with IDs, provide reasoning for each.\n\nThen final line: only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. All IDs are main. So we need to list unique IDs we identified.\n\nLet's compile unique IDs:\n\n- T1429 (Audio Capture)\n- T1616 (Call Control)\n- T1471 (Data Encrypted for Impact)\n- T1641 (Data Manipulation)\n- T1407 (Download New Code at Runtime)\n- T1626 (Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism)\n- T1417 (Input Capture)\n- T1430 (Location Tracking)\n- T1655 (Masquerading)\n- T1577 (Compromise Application Executable)\n- T1646 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel)\n- T1628 (Hide Artifacts)\n- T1544 (Ingress Tool Transfer)\n- T1617 (Hooking) maybe optional\n- T1629 (Impair Defenses) maybe optional\n\nWe need to decide which are clearly indicated. Let's be conservative: include those strongly indicated.\n\nStrongly indicated:\n\n- Audio Capture (record phone calls and audio) -> T1429.\n- Call Control (make phone calls) -> T1616.\n- Data Encrypted for Impact (ransomware encrypts data) -> T1471.\n- Data Manipulation (modify external storage) -> T1641.\n- Download New Code at Runtime (download APK) -> T1407.\n- Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (exploit performGlobalAction API) -> T1626.\n- Input Capture (keylogger) -> T1417.\n- Location Tracking (GPS) -> T1430.\n- Masquerading (pretend to be Google Play Protect, disguise updates) -> T1655.\n- Compromise Application Executable (install malicious apps) -> T1577.\n- Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (exfiltrate encrypted files) -> T1646.\n- Hide Artifacts (resist uninstallation) maybe but not explicit hide; it's resisting uninstall via API. Could be Impair Defenses (T1629). But we already have Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism. Might include Hide Artifacts as a technique for resisting uninstall. Let's include T1628.\n\n- Ingress Tool Transfer (download new code) maybe duplicate with T1407. Could include but not necessary.\n\n- Hooking (keylogger across all apps) maybe but not explicit hooking. Could be Input Capture only.\n\nThus final unique IDs: T1429, T1616, T1471, T1641, T1407, T1626, T1417, T1430, T1655, T1577, T1646, T1628.\n\nNow produce answer with reasoning for each.\n\nFinal line: list IDs separated by commas.\n\nLet's order maybe as they appear or numeric. Provide as: T1429, T1616, T1471, T1641, T1407, T1626, T1417, T1430, T1655, T1577, T1646, T1628\n\nNow craft answer.",

Could include both.\n\n- \"Keylogger across all applications\": Input Capture (T1417) and maybe \"Hooking\" (T1617) because hooking into all apps. Hooking is about intercepting API calls. Could be.\n\n- \"Record phone calls\": Audio Capture (T1429) as earlier.\n\n- \"Make phone calls\": Call Control (T1616).\n\n- \"Track GPS location\": Location Tracking (T1430).\n\n- \"Requested accessibility service privileges\": Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (T1626) again.\n\n- \"Masquerading as Google Play Protect\": Masquerading (T1655).\n\n- \"Disguised malicious app installations as legitimate system updates\": Masquerading (T1655) and maybe \"Compromise Application Executable\" (T1577) or \"Compromise Client Software Binary\" (T1645). The latter is about compromising client software binary. Installing malicious APK could be that. But we already have Download New Code.\n\nNow we need to list all identified techniques with IDs, provide reasoning for each.\n\nThen final line: only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. All IDs are main. So we need to list unique IDs we identified.\n\nLet's compile unique IDs:\n\n- T1429 (Audio Capture)\n- T1616 (Call Control)\n- T1471 (Data Encrypted for Impact)\n- T1641 (Data Manipulation)\n- T1407 (Download New Code at Runtime)\n- T1626 (Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism)\n- T1417 (Input Capture)\n- T1430 (Location Tracking)\n- T1655 (Masquerading)\n- T1577 (Compromise Application Executable)\n- T1646 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel)\n- T1628 (Hide Artifacts)\n- T1544 (Ingress Tool Transfer)\n- T1617 (Hooking) maybe optional\n- T1629 (Impair Defenses) maybe optional\n\nWe need to decide which are clearly indicated. Let's be conservative: include those strongly indicated.\n\nStrongly indicated:\n\n- Audio Capture (record phone calls and audio) -> T1429.\n- Call Control (make phone calls) -> T1616.\n- Data Encrypted for Impact (ransomware encrypts data) -> T1471.\n- Data Manipulation (modify external storage) -> T1641.\n- Download New Code at Runtime (download APK) -> T1407.\n- Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (exploit performGlobalAction API) -> T1626.\n- Input Capture (keylogger) -> T1417.\n- Location Tracking (GPS) -> T1430.\n- Masquerading (pretend to be Google Play Protect, disguise updates) -> T1655.\n- Compromise Application Executable (install malicious apps) -> T1577.\n- Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (exfiltrate encrypted files) -> T1646.\n- Hide Artifacts (resist uninstallation) maybe but not explicit hide; it's resisting uninstall via API. Could be Impair Defenses (T1629). But we already have Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism. Might include Hide Artifacts as a technique for resisting uninstall. Let's include T1628.\n\n- Ingress Tool Transfer (download new code) maybe duplicate with T1407. Could include but not necessary.\n\n- Hooking (keylogger across all apps) maybe but not explicit hooking. Could be Input Capture only.\n\nThus final unique IDs: T1429, T1616, T1471, T1641, T1407, T1626, T1417, T1430, T1655, T1577, T1646, T1628.\n\nNow produce answer with reasoning for each.\n\nFinal line: list IDs separated by commas.\n\nLet's order maybe as they appear or numeric. Provide as: T1429, T1616, T1471, T1641, T1407, T1626, T1417, T1430, T1655, T1577, T1646, T1628\n\nNow craft answer.",

        "a35913dfe72a88c6868acef841e36ce5": "We need to extract MITRE Mobile attack patterns from the text and map them to technique IDs. Provide reasoning for each identification. Then final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. The list provided includes only main technique IDs (no subtechnique). So we need to match descriptions in text to technique names.\n\nText summary:\n\n- Anubis is Android malware, espionage, banking trojan.\n- Capable of exfiltrating data encrypted with RC4 via ransomware module and can also record phone calls and audio, as well as make phone calls.\n- Ransomware module encrypts device data and hold it for ransom, while also exfiltrating encrypted files.\n- Modify external storage and download attacker-specified APK files.\n- To resist uninstallation, exploits Android performGlobalAction(int) API call.\n- Keylogger functions across all applications, can track GPS location.\n- Requested accessibility service privileges while masquerading as \"Google Play Protect\".\n- Disguised additional malicious application installations as legitimate system updates.\n\nNow map to MITRE Mobile technique IDs list.\n\nLet's list relevant techniques:\n\n- Record phone calls and audio: Audio Capture (T1429). Also Call Control (T1616) maybe for making phone calls? \"make phone calls\" could be Call Control (T1616) which is about controlling phone calls. Also \"record phone calls\" could be Audio Capture (T1429) or maybe \"Call Control\" includes intercepting calls. We'll include both.\n\n- Exfiltrating data encrypted with RC4: Data Encrypted for Impact (T1471) maybe? Actually Data Encrypted for Impact is about encrypting data for impact (ransomware). Also \"Encrypted Channel\" (T1521) is about encrypting exfiltration channel. But they encrypt data before exfil, not channel. So Data Encrypted for Impact (T1471) matches.\n\n- Modify external storage: Data Manipulation (T1641) maybe? Or \"Modify external storage\" could be \"Data Manipulation\". Also \"File and Directory Discovery\" not relevant. \"Modify external storage\" could be \"Data Manipulation\". Also \"Archive Collected Data\" not.\n\n- Download attacker-specified APK files: Download New Code at Runtime (T1407). Also \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1544) is about transferring tools. But downloading APK is new code. So T1407.\n\n- Resist uninstallation, exploits Android performGlobalAction(int) API call: This is about \"Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\" maybe? Actually performGlobalAction is a privileged API to perform actions like uninstall? Could be \"Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\" (T1404). Or \"Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism\" (T1626). The technique list includes T1626: Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism. That seems appropriate: using privileged API to prevent uninstall. So T1626.\n\n- Keylogger across all applications: Input Capture (T1417) maybe? Actually Input Capture is about capturing keystrokes. There's also \"Keylogging\" but not listed. Input Capture (T1417) is correct.\n\n- Track GPS location: Location Tracking (T1430).\n\n- Requested accessibility service privileges while masquerading as \"Google Play Protect\": This is about \"Masquerading\" (T1655). Also \"Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism\"? Accessibility service is a privileged permission. Could be \"Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism\" again. But we already have that. Also \"Subvert Trust Controls\" (T1632) maybe? Using accessibility service to bypass security. But we can map to \"Masquerading\" (T1655) for pretending to be Google Play Protect.\n\n- Disguised malicious app installations as legitimate system updates: Masquerading (T1655) again, also \"Compromise Application Executable\" (T1577) maybe? Installing malicious apps disguised as updates is a form of \"Compromise Application Executable\". But the list includes T1577: Compromise Application Executable. That could be relevant.\n\n- \"Make phone calls\": Call Control (T1616) maybe.\n\n- \"Exfiltrating encrypted files\": Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1646) maybe? Or Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1639). The text says exfiltrating encrypted files from the device. Could be generic exfiltration. The list includes T1646: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. We'll include that.\n\n- \"Modify external storage\": Data Manipulation (T1641) as earlier.\n\n- \"Ransomware module encrypts device data and hold it for ransom\": Data Encrypted for Impact (T1471) and Data Destruction (T1662) maybe? Not destruction, just encryption.\n\n- \"Resist uninstallation\": Hide Artifacts (T1628) maybe? Hide Artifacts is about hiding presence. Resist uninstall could be Hide Artifacts. Also \"Impair Defenses\" (T1629) maybe. But we already have Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism. Could also be \"Impair Defenses\". However we need to map to technique IDs from list. Hide Artifacts (T1628) seems plausible.\n\n- \"Download attacker-specified APK files\": Ingress Tool Transfer (T1544) also relevant. But we already have Download New Code at Runtime (T1407). Could include both.\n\n- \"Keylogger across all applications\": Input Capture (T1417) and maybe \"Hooking\" (T1617) because hooking into all apps. Hooking is about intercepting API calls. Could be.\n\n- \"Record phone calls\": Audio Capture (T1429) as earlier.\n\n- \"Make phone calls\": Call Control (T1616).\n\n- \"Track GPS location\": Location Tracking (T1430).\n\n- \"Requested accessibility service privileges\": Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (T1626) again.\n\n- \"Masquerading as Google Play Protect\": Masquerading (T1655).\n\n- \"Disguised malicious app installations as legitimate system updates\": Masquerading (T1655) and maybe \"Compromise Application Executable\" (T1577) or \"Compromise Client Software Binary\" (T1645). The latter is about compromising client software binary. Installing malicious APK could be that. But we already have Download New Code.\n\nNow we need to list all identified techniques with IDs, provide reasoning for each.\n\nThen final line: only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. All IDs are main. So we need to list unique IDs we identified.\n\nLet's compile unique IDs:\n\n- T1429 (Audio Capture)\n- T1616 (Call Control)\n- T1471 (Data Encrypted for Impact)\n- T1641 (Data Manipulation)\n- T1407 (Download New Code at Runtime)\n- T1626 (Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism)\n- T1417 (Input Capture)\n- T1430 (Location Tracking)\n- T1655 (Masquerading)\n- T1577 (Compromise Application Executable)\n- T1646 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel)\n- T1628 (Hide Artifacts)\n- T1544 (Ingress Tool Transfer)\n- T1617 (Hooking) maybe optional\n- T1629 (Impair Defenses) maybe optional\n\nWe need to decide which are clearly indicated. Let's be conservative: include those strongly indicated.\n\nStrongly indicated:\n\n- Audio Capture (record phone calls and audio) -> T1429.\n- Call Control (make phone calls) -> T1616.\n- Data Encrypted for Impact (ransomware encrypts data) -> T1471.\n- Data Manipulation (modify external storage) -> T1641.\n- Download New Code at Runtime (download APK) -> T1407.\n- Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (exploit performGlobalAction API) -> T1626.\n- Input Capture (keylogger) -> T1417.\n- Location Tracking (GPS) -> T1430.\n- Masquerading (pretend to be Google Play Protect, disguise updates) -> T1655.\n- Compromise Application Executable (install malicious apps) -> T1577.\n- Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (exfiltrate encrypted files) -> T1646.\n- Hide Artifacts (resist uninstallation) maybe but not explicit hide; it's resisting uninstall via API. Could be Impair Defenses (T1629). But we already have Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism. Might include Hide Artifacts as a technique for resisting uninstall. Let's include T1628.\n\n- Ingress Tool Transfer (download new code) maybe duplicate with T1407. Could include but not necessary.\n\n- Hooking (keylogger across all apps) maybe but not explicit hooking. Could be Input Capture only.\n\nThus final unique IDs: T1429, T1616, T1471, T1641, T1407, T1626, T1417, T1430, T1655, T1577, T1646, T1628.\n\nNow produce answer with reasoning for each.\n\nFinal line: list IDs separated by commas.\n\nLet's order maybe as they appear or numeric. Provide as: T1429, T1616, T1471, T1641, T1407, T1626, T1417, T1430, T1655, T1577, T1646, T1628\n\nNow craft answer.",

        "description": "AppleJeus is a malware family of downloaders first discovered in 2018, embedded within trojanized cryptocurrency applications. This malware, attributed to the Lazarus Group, has targeted organizations in various sectors, including energy, finance, government, technology, and telecommunications, across multiple countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, South Korea, Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, and Russia. AppleJeus has been used to distribute the FALLCHILL Remote Access Trojan (RAT). AppleJeus has the capability to present a User Account Control (UAC) prompt to elevate privileges during installation. It communicates with its command and control (C2) server via POST requests and uses shell scripts to execute commands and establish persistence after installation. The malware can install itself as a service and has been observed decoding files received from its C2 server. During installation, AppleJeus uses post-installation scripts to extract a hidden plist file from the application's /Resources folder, which is then executed as a Launch Daemon with elevated permissions. Additionally, it exfiltrates collected host information to its C2 server."

              "description": "AppleJeus is a malware family of downloaders first discovered in 2018, embedded within trojanized cryptocurrency applications. This malware, attributed to the Lazarus Group, has targeted organizations in various sectors, including energy, finance, government, technology, and telecommunications, across multiple countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, South Korea, Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, and Russia. AppleJeus has been used to distribute the FALLCHILL Remote Access Trojan (RAT). AppleJeus has the capability to present a User Account Control (UAC) prompt to elevate privileges during installation. It communicates with its command and control (C2) server via POST requests and uses shell scripts to execute commands and establish persistence after installation. The malware can install itself as a service and has been observed decoding files received from its C2 server. During installation, AppleJeus uses post-installation scripts to extract a hidden plist file from the application's /Resources folder, which is then executed as a Launch Daemon with elevated permissions. Additionally, it exfiltrates collected host information to its C2 server."

This malware, attributed to the Lazarus Group, has targeted organizations in various sectors, including energy, finance, government, technology, and telecommunications, across multiple countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, South Korea, Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, and Russia. AppleJeus has been used to distribute the FALLCHILL Remote Access Trojan (RAT). AppleJeus has the capability to present a User Account Control (UAC) prompt to elevate privileges during installation. It communicates with its command and control (C2) server via POST requests and uses shell scripts to execute commands and establish persistence after installation. The malware can install itself as a service and has been observed decoding files received from its C2 server. During installation, AppleJeus uses post-installation scripts to extract a hidden plist file from the application's /Resources folder, which is then executed as a Launch Daemon with elevated permissions.

Also could be \"Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\" (T1068) but specifically UAC prompt is T1548. So T1548.\n\n- \"communicates with its command and control (C2) server via POST requests\" => Application Layer Protocol (T1071) maybe \"Web protocols\"? Could be \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) but communication is C2. The technique is \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071). Also \"Web Service\" (T1102) but POST requests is typical HTTP. So T1071.\n\n- \"uses shell scripts to execute commands and establish persistence after installation.\" => Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059). Also \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" (T1547) maybe for persistence via scripts? But they use shell scripts to execute commands; that's T1059.\n\n- \"install itself as a service\" => Create or Modify System Process (T1543) subtechnique \"Windows Service\" but main technique T1543.\n\n- \"decoding files received from its C2 server.\" => Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information (T1140). Also \"Data Encoding\" (T1132) but decoding is T1140.\n\n- \"extract a hidden plist file from the application's /Resources folder, which is then executed as a Launch Daemon with elevated permissions.\" => Plist File Modification (T1647) maybe also \"Create or Modify System Process\" again. Launch Daemon is a service. So T1647.\n\n- \"exfiltrates collected host information to its C2 server.\" => Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041) or Automated Exfiltration (T1020). Since exfiltration to C2, T1041.\n\n- \"collect host information\" => Gather Victim Host Information (T1592). Also System Information Discovery (T1082). The text says \"collected host information\". So T1592.\n\n- \"post-installation scripts to extract hidden plist file\" also indicates \"Modify Registry\"? Not exactly. So we have list.\n\n- Also \"downloaders\" maybe \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1105) but not explicit.\n\n- \"AppleJeus has been used to distribute the FALLCHILL Remote Access Trojan (RAT).\" => \"Remote Access Software\" (T1219) maybe.\n\n- \"malware family of downloaders\" could be \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1105) but not explicit.\n\n- \"establish persistence after installation\" could be \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" (T1547) but not explicit method.\n\n- \"shell scripts to execute commands\" also \"Native API\" (T1106) but not.\n\n- \"install as a service\" is T1543.\n\n- \"present a UAC prompt\" is T1548.\n\n- \"communicates via POST requests\" is T1071.\n\n- \"exfiltrates host info\" is T1041 and T1592.\n\n- \"decoding files\" is T1140.\n\n- \"hidden plist file executed as Launch Daemon\" is T1647 (Plist File Modification) and also T1543.\n\n- \"use shell scripts\" is T1059.\n\nThus main techniques: T1548, T1071, T1059, T1543, T1140, T1647, T1041, T1592.\n\nCheck if any other technique: \"establish persistence\" could be T1547 but not explicit method; we could include but maybe not needed.\n\nNow produce reasoning for each identification.\n\nFinally final line: list IDs separated by commas, only main technique IDs (no subtechnique).

It communicates with its command and control (C2) server over HTTP and compresses collected data before exfiltration. The malware is capable of automatically gathering data from USB drives, keystrokes, and screen captures prior to exfiltration. For persistence, AppleSeed creates the Registry key `EstsoftAutoUpdate` at `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce`. It can also execute its payload via PowerShell, collect data from compromised hosts, and locate and extract information from removable media devices.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID

MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** AppleSeed is a backdoor used by the Kimsuky group to target South Korean government, academic, and commercial entities since at least 2021.  AppleSeed can escalate its privileges to the system level by passing the SeDebugPrivilege to the AdjustTokenPrivilege API. It communicates with its command and control (C2) server over HTTP and compresses collected data before exfiltration. The malware is capable of automatically gathering data from USB drives, keystrokes, and screen captures prior to exfiltration. For persistence, AppleSeed creates the Registry key `EstsoftAutoUpdate` at `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce`. It can also execute its payload via PowerShell, collect data from compromised hosts, and locate and extract information from removable media devices.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID

Need to parse the text:\n\n\"AppleSeed is a backdoor used by the Kimsuky group to target South Korean government, academic, and commercial entities since at least 2021.

For persistence, AppleSeed creates the Registry key `EstsoftAutoUpdate` at `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce`. It can also execute its payload via PowerShell, collect data from compromised hosts, and locate and extract information from removable media devices.\"\n\nWe need to map each described behavior to technique IDs.\n\nBehaviors:\n\n- Backdoor: not a technique.\n\n- Escalate privileges to system level by passing SeDebugPrivilege to AdjustTokenPrivilege API. That's Access Token Manipulation (T1134) or Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism (T1548). Actually passing SeDebugPrivilege to AdjustTokenPrivilege is token manipulation. MITRE technique: \"Access Token Manipulation\" T1134. Also \"Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism\" T1548 (privilege escalation via token). Which is more appropriate? T1548 is \"Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism\". The description: \"passing the SeDebugPrivilege to the AdjustTokenPrivilege API\" is token manipulation. So T1134.\n\n- Communicates with C2 over HTTP: Application Layer Protocol (T1071) (specifically HTTP). So T1071.\n\n- Compresses collected data before exfiltration: Archive Collected Data (T1560). Also maybe Data Encoding (T1132) but compression is archiving. So T1560.\n\n- Gathering data from USB drives: Data from Removable Media (T1025). Also \"Automated Collection\" (T1119) maybe but specific to removable media. So T1025.\n\n- Keystrokes: Input Capture (T1056). Could be \"Keylogging\". So T1056.\n\n- Screen captures: Screen Capture (T1113). So T1113.\n\n- Persistence via Registry RunOnce key: Modify Registry (T1112) or \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" (T1547) subtechnique \"Registry Run Keys/Startup Folder\". Since we only include main technique IDs, T1547 is the main. Also T1112 is modify registry. The persistence technique is \"Registry Run Keys/Startup Folder\" which falls under T1547. So T1547.\n\n- Execute payload via PowerShell: Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059) subtechnique PowerShell. Main technique T1059.\n\n- Collect data from compromised hosts: maybe \"Automated Collection\" (T1119) or \"Data from Local System\" (T1005). Since they collect data from hosts, generic. Could map to \"Data from Local System\" T1005.\n\n- Locate and extract information from removable media devices: again Data from Removable Media (T1025).\n\nThus list of techniques identified:\n\n- T1134 (Access Token Manipulation)\n- T1071 (Application Layer Protocol)\n- T1560 (Archive Collected Data)\n- T1025 (Data from Removable Media)\n- T1056 (Input Capture)\n- T1113 (Screen Capture)\n- T1547 (Boot or Logon Autostart Execution)\n- T1112 (Modify Registry) maybe but we already have T1547; but we could include both. The description: creates registry key for persistence. That's both modify registry and autostart. We'll include both T1112 and T1547.\n- T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter)\n- T1005 (Data from Local System)\n\nAlso maybe \"Automated Collection\" T1119 for automatic gathering. Could include.\n\nBut we need to extract all MITRE Enterprise attack patterns from text. So include all that apply.\n\nLet's list each with reasoning.\n\nNow final line: only IDs for main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs. Main techniques are those we listed (they are main). Should we include T1112? It's a main technique. Yes.\n\nThus final line: T1134,T1071,T1560,T1025,T1056,T1113,T1547,T1112,T1059,T1005,T1119\n\nCheck duplicates: T1119 maybe optional. The text says \"automatically gathering data\". That's automated collection. So include.\n\nNow produce answer with reasoning per technique, then final line.\n\n",

Final line: only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. The list provided includes IDs and names. Need to match text descriptions to technique names.\n\nText mentions:\n\n- \"banking trojan designed to steal money from victims' bank accounts by initiating wire transfers via SMS from compromised devices.\" => This is \"SMS Control\" (T1582). Also maybe \"Account Access Removal\"? No. So T1582.\n\n- \"request device administrator permissions to enhance its control over the infected device.\" => That's \"Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism\" (T1626). Could also be \"Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\" (T1404) but specifically requesting admin permissions is abuse of elevation control. So T1626.\n\n- \"communicates with its command and control (C2) server using HTTP POST requests, with C2 communications encrypted using Base64-encoded RC4.\" => This is \"Encrypted Channel\" (T1521). Also \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1437) maybe because HTTP POST. But main is encrypted channel. So T1521.\n\n- \"masquerades as a client of popular free ad services to deceive users.\" => That's \"Masquerading\" (T1655).\n\n- \"implements some of its functions in native code and stores encrypted strings within the APK file.\" => \"Native API\" (T1575) maybe, but also \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1406). The storing encrypted strings is obfuscation. So T1406. Native code could be \"Native API\". We'll include both.\n\n- \"capable of collecting the device’s contact list\" => That's \"Credentials from Password Store\"? No. Contact list is personal data, maybe \"Data from Local System\" (T1533) or \"System Information Discovery\" (T1426) but contact list is \"Data from Local System\". So T1533.\n\n- \"sending SMS messages from compromised devices\" => again SMS Control (T1582) already captured.\n\n- \"gathering various device information, such as the device model and OS version.\" => That's \"System Information Discovery\" (T1426).\n\n- Also \"collecting device’s contact list\" could be \"Stored Application Data\" (T1409) but not exactly. We'll stick with T1533.\n\n- \"communicates with C2 using HTTP POST\" could be \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1437). Might include.\n\n- \"encrypted strings within the APK file\" also \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1406).\n\n- \"request device administrator permissions\" also \"Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism\" (T1626).\n\n- \"initiating wire transfers via SMS\" maybe \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\"? Not exactly. It's using SMS to send commands? That's \"SMS Control\". Already.\n\n- \"compromise client software binary\"? Not mentioned.\n\nThus list of identified techniques:\n\n- T1582 (SMS Control)\n- T1626 (Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism)\n- T1521 (Encrypted Channel)\n- T1655 (",

Text: \"ASPXSpy is a web shell that has been modified by Threat Group-3390 to create a variant known as ASPXTool. This modified version has been deployed by the group on accessible servers running Internet Information Services (IIS).\"\n\nWe need to identify techniques described. Web shell deployment on IIS: This is likely \"Web Shell\" is a type of \"Web Service\" or \"Web Shell\" is a technique: \"Web Shell\" is T1100? Actually MITRE technique: \"Web Shell\" is T1505.003? Wait that's subtechnique of \"Server Software Component\"? Let's recall: T1505 is \"Server Software Component\". Subtechnique T1505.003 is \"Web Shell\". However subtechnique IDs are not in list; only main technique IDs are given. The list includes T1505: Server Software Component. So we can map to T1505.\n\nAlso \"Deploying on accessible servers running IIS\" could be \"Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\"? Not exactly. Could be \"Exploitation for Client Execution\"? Not. Could be \"Exploiting Public-Facing Application\" (T1190) if they use web shell to exploit. But the text says they deployed web shell on accessible servers. That is \"Web Shell\" (T1505.003). So main technique T1505.\n\nAlso \"Modify web shell\" could be \"Modify Existing Service\"? Not. Could be \"Modify Registry\"? No.\n\nAlso \"ASPXSpy is a web shell\" indicates \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) maybe used to execute commands via web shell. But not explicit.\n\nThe main technique is \"Server Software Component\" (T1505). Also maybe \"Web Service\" (T1102) but that's about using web services for C2. Not.\n\nThus we likely only have one technique.\n\nWe need to provide reasoning for each identification.\n\nFinally final line: only IDs for main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs. So \"T1505\".\n\nCheck list includes T1505: Server Software Component. Yes.\n\nThus answer: Provide mapping and reasoning, then final line \"T1505\".",

The at command schedules tasks. This maps to technique \"Scheduled Task/Job\" which is T1053. Also possibly \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" (T1547) but specifically scheduling tasks is T1053. Also \"Create or Modify System Process\" (T1543) maybe but not directly. The text mentions scheduling tasks to run at a specified date and time. That's T1053 (Scheduled Task/Job). Also could be \"Job Scheduling\" subtechnique T1053.005 (Scheduled Task/Job: At). But we need main technique IDs only, exclude subtechnique IDs. So T1053.\n\nAny other technique? The at command is a native OS command, could be \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) because using at command is a command interpreter. But the primary pattern is scheduling tasks. The question: \"Extract all MITRE Enterprise attack patterns from the following text and map them to their corresponding MITRE technique IDs.\" So we need to list each identified technique with reasoning. Likely only T1053. Possibly also T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) because at is a command. But the text is about scheduling tasks, not about using command interpreter for execution. The technique \"Scheduled Task/Job\" is the best.\n\nThus final line: T1053\n\nProvide reasoning for each identification.\n\nLet's craft answer: list technique name and ID, reasoning. Then final line with IDs.\n\n",

While the primary focus of the sentence is the scheduling capability, the act of using a native command could also be considered the use of a command‑line interpreter. However, the core ATT&CK pattern described is task scheduling, so T1053 is the main technique. |\n\n**Final list of main technique IDs (sub‑technique IDs omitted):**  \nT1053"

AuTo Stealer communicates with its command and control (C2) servers using HTTP or TCP. It maintains persistence by placing malicious executables in the AutoRun registry key or StartUp directory, depending on the installed antivirus (AV) product. The malware can execute a batch file using `cmd.exe`. AuTo Stealer is capable of collecting various types of data from an infected machine, including PowerPoint files, Word documents, Excel files, PDF files, text files, database files, and image files. This collected data is stored in a file named `Hostname_UserName.txt` before exfiltration. The malware then exfiltrates the data to actor-controlled C2 servers via HTTP or TCP. Additionally, AuTo Stealer can gather information about the installed AV products on an infected host.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control

We need to identify which techniques are described in the text.\n\nText summary:\n\n- AuTo Stealer is malware written in C++ used by SideCopy targeting agencies.\n- Communicates with C2 using HTTP or TCP.\n- Maintains persistence by placing malicious executables in the AutoRun registry key or Startup directory, depending on AV product.\n- Can execute a batch file using cmd.exe.\n- Capable of collecting various types of data from infected machine: Power, Word, Excel, PDF, text, database, image files. Stored in a file named Hostname_UserName.txt before exfiltration.\n- Exfiltrates data to C2 via HTTP or TCP.\n- Can gather information about installed AV products on host.\n\nThus techniques:\n\n- Command and Control: Application Layer Protocol (T1071) for HTTP/TCP? Actually T1071 is Application Layer Protocol. Also Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041) maybe. But exfiltration via HTTP/TCP is also T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) or T1048 (Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol). The list includes T1041 and T1048. The text says exfiltrates data via HTTP or TCP to C2 servers. That's exfiltration over C2 channel (T1041). Also communication with C2 using HTTP/TCP is also Application Layer Protocol (T1071). So both.\n\n- Persistence: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (T1547) via registry Run key or Startup folder. Also Modify Registry (T1112) maybe for placing in AutoRun registry key. But the technique is \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys/Startup Folder\" which is subtechnique of T1547. Since we exclude subtechnique IDs, we just list T1547.\n\n- Execution: Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059) for cmd.exe batch file. Also maybe \"Native API\" but not needed. So T1059.\n\n- Collection: Automated Collection (T1119) maybe, but also \"Data from Local System\" (T1005) for collecting files. Also \"Archive Collected Data\" (T1560) maybe not mentioned. The text says collects various file types and stores in a file before exfiltration. That's Data from Local System (T1005). Also \"Automated Collection\" (T1119) could be considered but not explicit. We'll include T1005.\n\n- Discovery: Query Registry (T1012) for AV products? Actually gathering info about installed AV products is \"Software Discovery\" (T1518) or \"Security Software Discovery\" (not in list). There's \"Gather Victim Host Information\" (T1592) maybe. But we have \"Gather Victim Host Information\" (T1592). Also \"Software Discovery\" (T1518) is about installed software. The list includes T1518: Software Discovery. So we can map to that. Also \"System Information Discovery\" (T1082) maybe for host info, but specifically AV products is software discovery. So T1518.\n\n- Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041) and maybe \"Exfiltration Over Web Service\" (T1567) but not mentioned. So T1041.\n\n- Also \"Data Staged\" (T1074) maybe because they store data in a file before exfiltration. Could be considered staging. But not explicit. Might include.\n\n- \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) for cmd.exe.\n\n- \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" (T1547) for persistence.\n\n- \"Modify Registry\" (T1112) maybe but the persistence technique already covers.\n\n- \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) for C2 communications.\n\nThus main techniques: T1071, T1041, T1547, T1059, T1005, T1518, T1082? maybe not. Also \"Gather Victim Host Information\" (T1592) could be used. But we need to map each identified pattern to ID.\n\nLet's list each with reasoning.\n\nNow final line: IDs for main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs. Which are main? The ones we identified: T1071, T1041, T1547, T1059, T1005, T1518, maybe T1082? But we can include T1082 if we think host info includes AV products. However T1518 is more specific. We'll include both? Might be redundant. Provide reasoning for each.\n\nLet's produce answer with bullet list: technique name, ID, reasoning.\n\nThen final line: \"T1071,T1041,T1547,T1059,T1005,T1518\". Ensure no subtechnique IDs (like T1547.001). Good.\n\n",

Might include.\n\n- \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) for cmd.exe.\n\n- \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" (T1547) for persistence.\n\n- \"Modify Registry\" (T1112) maybe but the persistence technique already covers.\n\n- \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) for C2 communications.\n\nThus main techniques: T1071, T1041, T1547, T1059, T1005, T1518, T1082? maybe not. Also \"Gather Victim Host Information\" (T1592) could be used. But we need to map each identified pattern to ID.\n\nLet's list each with reasoning.\n\nNow final line: IDs for main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs. Which are main? The ones we identified: T1071, T1041, T1547, T1059, T1005, T1518, maybe T1082? But we can include T1082 if we think host info includes AV products. However T1518 is more specific. We'll include both? Might be redundant. Provide reasoning for each.\n\nLet's produce answer with bullet list: technique name, ID, reasoning.\n\nThen final line: \"T1071,T1041,T1547,T1059,T1005,T1518\". Ensure no subtechnique IDs (like T1547.001). Good.\n\n",

Provide reasoning for each identification. Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** AuTo Stealer is malware written in C++ that has been used by SideCopy since at least December 2021 to target government agencies and personnel in India and Afghanistan. AuTo Stealer communicates with its command and control (C2) servers using HTTP or TCP. It maintains persistence by placing malicious executables in the AutoRun registry key or StartUp directory, depending on the installed antivirus (AV) product. The malware can execute a batch file using `cmd.exe`. AuTo Stealer is capable of collecting various types of data from an infected machine, including PowerPoint files, Word documents, Excel files, PDF files, text files, database files, and image files. This collected data is stored in a file named `Hostname_UserName.txt` before exfiltration. The malware then exfiltrates the data to actor-controlled C2 servers via HTTP or TCP. Additionally, AuTo Stealer can gather information about the installed AV products on an infected host.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control

        "53010f4db5c8c8ef166fecb90a22ede3": "AuTo Stealer is malware written in C++ that has been used by SideCopy since at least December 2021 to target government agencies and personnel in India and Afghanistan. AuTo Stealer communicates with its command and control (C2) servers using HTTP or TCP. It maintains persistence by placing malicious executables in the AutoRun registry key or StartUp directory, depending on the installed antivirus (AV) product. The malware can execute a batch file using `cmd.exe`. AuTo Stealer is capable of collecting various types of data from an infected machine, including PowerPoint files, Word documents, Excel files, PDF files, text files, database files, and image files. This collected data is stored in a file named `Hostname_UserName.txt` before exfiltration. The malware then exfiltrates the data to actor-controlled C2 servers via HTTP or TCP. Additionally, AuTo Stealer can gather information about the installed AV products on an infected host.",
        "9c2c8887fbda8b74683c28226f8faaa3": "We need to extract MITRE Enterprise attack patterns (techniques) from the text, map to IDs, provide reasoning, and final line only IDs for main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs. The list includes many IDs. We need to identify which techniques are described in the text.\n\nText summary:\n\n- AuTo Stealer is malware written in C++ used by SideCopy targeting agencies.\n- Communicates with C2 using HTTP or TCP.\n- Maintains persistence by placing malicious executables in the AutoRun registry key or Startup directory, depending on AV product.\n- Can execute a batch file using cmd.exe.\n- Capable of collecting various types of data from infected machine: Power, Word, Excel, PDF, text, database, image files. Stored in a file named Hostname_UserName.txt before exfiltration.\n- Exfiltrates data to C2 via HTTP or TCP.\n- Can gather information about installed AV products on host.\n\nThus techniques:\n\n- Command and Control: Application Layer Protocol (T1071) for HTTP/TCP? Actually T1071 is Application Layer Protocol. Also Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041) maybe. But exfiltration via HTTP/TCP is also T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) or T1048 (Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol). The list includes T1041 and T1048. The text says exfiltrates data via HTTP or TCP to C2 servers. That's exfiltration over C2 channel (T1041). Also communication with C2 using HTTP/TCP is also Application Layer Protocol (T1071). So both.\n\n- Persistence: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution (T1547) via registry Run key or Startup folder. Also Modify Registry (T1112) maybe for placing in AutoRun registry key. But the technique is \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys/Startup Folder\" which is subtechnique of T1547. Since we exclude subtechnique IDs, we just list T1547.\n\n- Execution: Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059) for cmd.exe batch file. Also maybe \"Native API\" but not needed. So T1059.\n\n- Collection: Automated Collection (T1119) maybe, but also \"Data from Local System\" (T1005) for collecting files. Also \"Archive Collected Data\" (T1560) maybe not mentioned. The text says collects various file types and stores in a file before exfiltration. That's Data from Local System (T1005). Also \"Automated Collection\" (T1119) could be considered but not explicit. We'll include T1005.\n\n- Discovery: Query Registry (T1012) for AV products? Actually gathering info about installed AV products is \"Software Discovery\" (T1518) or \"Security Software Discovery\" (not in list). There's \"Gather Victim Host Information\" (T1592) maybe. But we have \"Gather Victim Host Information\" (T1592). Also \"Software Discovery\" (T1518) is about installed software. The list includes T1518: Software Discovery. So we can map to that. Also \"System Information Discovery\" (T1082) maybe for host info, but specifically AV products is software discovery. So T1518.\n\n- Exfiltration: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041) and maybe \"Exfiltration Over Web Service\" (T1567) but not mentioned. So T1041.\n\n- Also \"Data Staged\" (T1074) maybe because they store data in a file before exfiltration. Could be considered staging. But not explicit. Might include.\n\n- \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) for cmd.exe.\n\n- \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" (T1547) for persistence.\n\n- \"Modify Registry\" (T1112) maybe but the persistence technique already covers.\n\n- \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) for C2 communications.\n\nThus main techniques: T1071, T1041, T1547, T1059, T1005, T1518, T1082? maybe not. Also \"Gather Victim Host Information\" (T1592) could be used. But we need to map each identified pattern to ID.\n\nLet's list each with reasoning.\n\nNow final line: IDs for main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs. Which are main? The ones we identified: T1071, T1041, T1547, T1059, T1005, T1518, maybe T1082? But we can include T1082 if we think host info includes AV products. However T1518 is more specific. We'll include both? Might be redundant. Provide reasoning for each.\n\nLet's produce answer with bullet list: technique name, ID, reasoning.\n\nThen final line: \"T1071,T1041,T1547,T1059,T1005,T1518\". Ensure no subtechnique IDs (like T1547.001). Good.\n\n",

This malware leverages the legitimate AutoIt scripting language, designed for Windows GUI automation, for malicious purposes. The AutoIt backdoor attempts to escalate privileges by bypassing User Account Control (UAC). It downloads a PowerShell script that decodes into a standard shellcode loader and communicates with its command and control (C2) server using base64-encoded responses. Additionally, the backdoor is capable of identifying and targeting documents on the victim's system with specific extensions, including .doc, .pdf, .csv, .ppt, .docx, .pst, .xls, .xlsx, .pptx, and .jpeg."

This malware leverages the legitimate AutoIt scripting language, designed for Windows GUI automation, for malicious purposes. The AutoIt backdoor attempts to escalate privileges by bypassing User Account Control (UAC). It downloads a PowerShell script that decodes into a standard shellcode loader and communicates with its command and control (C2) server using base64-encoded responses. Additionally, the backdoor is capable of identifying and targeting documents on the victim's system with specific extensions, including .doc, .pdf, .csv, .ppt, .docx, .pst, .xls, .xlsx, .pptx, and

Written in Delphi and named by its author, DarkGate has seen a significant increase in use since 2022 and is actively being developed as a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) offering. DarkGate employs two distinct User Account Control (UAC) bypass techniques to escalate privileges and utilizes parent PID spoofing as part of its \"rootkit-like\" features to evade detection by tools like Task Manager or Process Explorer. During execution, the malware elevates accounts it creates to the local administrator group. The command and control (C2) infrastructure of DarkGate includes hard-coded domains designed to mimic legitimate services like Akamai CDN or Amazon Web Services. It also disguises C2 traffic within DNS records associated with legitimate services to evade reputation-based detection. DarkGate is capable of searching for cryptocurrency wallets by scanning application window names for specific strings and uses the FindWindow API function to extract data collected via NirSoft tools from the hosting process's memory. When stored credentials linked to cryptocurrency wallets are identified, DarkGate alerts its C2 server.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control

Provide reasoning for each identification. Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** DarkGate, first identified in 2018, has evolved into a versatile tool used in various criminal cyber operations, including initial access, data gathering, credential theft, cryptomining, cryptotheft, and pre-ransomware activities. Written in Delphi and named by its author, DarkGate has seen a significant increase in use since 2022 and is actively being developed as a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) offering. DarkGate employs two distinct User Account Control (UAC) bypass techniques to escalate privileges and utilizes parent PID spoofing as part of its \"rootkit-like\" features to evade detection by tools like Task Manager or Process Explorer. During execution, the malware elevates accounts it creates to the local administrator group. The command and control (C2) infrastructure of DarkGate includes hard-coded domains designed to mimic legitimate services like Akamai CDN or Amazon Web Services. It also disguises C2 traffic within DNS records associated with legitimate services to evade reputation-based detection. DarkGate is capable of searching for cryptocurrency wallets by scanning application window names for specific strings and uses the FindWindow API function to extract data collected via NirSoft tools from the hosting process's memory. When stored credentials linked to cryptocurrency wallets are identified, DarkGate alerts its C2 server.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control

Written in Delphi and named by its author, DarkGate has seen a significant increase in use since 2022 and is actively being developed as a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) offering. DarkGate employs two distinct User Account Control (UAC) bypass techniques to escalate privileges and utilizes parent PID spoofing as part of its \"rootkit-like\" features to evade detection by tools like Task Manager or Process Explorer. During execution, the malware elevates accounts it creates to the local administrator group. The command and control (C2) infrastructure of DarkGate includes hard-coded domains designed to mimic legitimate services like Akamai CDN or Amazon Web Services. It also disguises C2 traffic within DNS records associated with legitimate services to evade reputation-based detection. DarkGate is capable of searching for cryptocurrency wallets by scanning application window names for specific strings and uses the FindWindow API function to extract data collected via NirSoft tools from the hosting process's memory. When stored credentials linked to cryptocurrency wallets are identified, DarkGate alerts its C2 server."

Need to identify which techniques are described in the text.\n\nText: \"NGLite is a backdoor Trojan designed to execute commands received through its command and control (C2) channel. While its capabilities are typical for a backdoor, NGLite stands out for using a novel C2 channel that leverages a decentralized network based on the legitimate NKN (New Kind of Network) protocol for communication between the backdoor and threat actors. NGLite initially beacons to the NKN network via an HTTP POST request over TCP port 30003. It uses an AES-encrypted channel for C2 communication, with one observed instance employing the encryption key \"WHATswrongwithUu.\" NGLite abuses NKN infrastructure to facilitate its C2 communication. It identifies the victim system's MAC and IPv4 addresses to establish a unique victim identifier. Additionally, NGLite executes the \"whoami\" command to collect system information and transmit it back to the C2 server.\"\n\nIdentify techniques:\n\n- Command and control channel using HTTP POST over TCP port 30003: Application Layer Protocol (T1071) maybe? Actually T1071 is \"Application Layer Protocol\". Also \"Non-Application Layer Protocol\" T1095? But they use HTTP POST, which is application layer. So T1071.\n\n- Use of encrypted channel for C2: \"Encrypted Channel\" T1573 (Encrypted Channel). Also \"Data Encrypted for Impact\" T1486? No that's for impact. So T1573.\n\n- Use of novel C2 channel leveraging decentralized network: Could be \"Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol\" T1048? Not exactly. It's C2, not exfil. Could be \"Proxy\" T1090? Not exactly. Might be \"Network Service Discovery\"? No. The technique \"Use of Non-Standard Port\" T1571? They use TCP port 30003, which is non-standard. So T1571.\n\n- Identify victim's MAC and IPv4 addresses to establish unique identifier: That's \"System Network Configuration Discovery\" T1016 (System Network Configuration Discovery) or \"Network Share Discovery\"? Actually MAC address is part of network configuration. So T1016.\n\n- Execute \"whoami\" command to collect system information: That's \"System Information Discovery\" T1082 (System Information Discovery) or \"Account Discovery\" T1087? whoami returns current user name, which is system owner/user discovery (T1033) or \"Account Discovery\". The technique \"System Owner/User Discovery\" T1033. Also \"Account Discovery\" T1087 is about enumerating accounts. whoami reveals current user, so T1033.\n\n- Backdoor Trojan designed to execute commands received through its C2 channel: \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" T1059? Actually executing commands is part of \"Command Execution\". Could be \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" T1059. Also \"Remote Services\" maybe? But it's local execution of commands from C2. So T1059.\n\n- \"Backdoor\" typical capabilities: maybe \"Remote Access Software\" T1219? But not described.\n\n- \"Abuses NKN infrastructure to facilitate its C2 communication\": Could be \"Exploitation of Public-Facing Application\"? No. Might be \"Use of External Remote Services\" T1133? Not exactly.\n\n- \"Beaconing\" is part of \"Ingress Tool Transfer\"? Not.\n\n- \"C2 channel that leverages decentralized network\" could be \"Network Service Discovery\"? Not.\n\n- \"HTTP POST request\" also could be \"Web Service\" T1102? Actually T1102 is \"Web Service\". But they use HTTP POST to NKN network, which is a protocol. Could be \"Web Service\" but not necessarily.\n\n- \"AES-encrypted channel\" is encryption for C2: T1573.\n\n- \"Identify victim system's MAC and IPv4 addresses\": T1016.\n\n- \"Collect system information\" via whoami: T1082 (system info) and T1033 (owner/user discovery). The text says \"collect system information\" but specifically whoami. So we can map to T1033.\n\n- \"Transmit it back to the C2 server\": Data exfil? That's \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" T1041. But they send system info back via C2. That is exfiltration over C2 channel. So T1041.\n\n- \"Backdoor Trojan designed to execute commands received through its C2 channel\": Could be \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" T1059.\n\n- \"Uses AES-encrypted channel for C2 communication\": T1573.\n\n- \"Beacon to NKN network via HTTP POST request over TCP port 30003\": T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) and T1571 (Non-Standard Port).

Need to identify which techniques are described in the text.\n\nText: \"NGLite is a backdoor Trojan designed to execute commands received through its command and control (C2) channel. While its capabilities are typical for a backdoor, NGLite stands out for using a novel C2 channel that leverages a decentralized network based on the legitimate NKN (New Kind of Network) protocol for communication between the backdoor and threat actors. NGLite initially beacons to the NKN network via an HTTP POST request over TCP port 30003. It uses an AES-encrypted channel for C2 communication, with one observed instance employing the encryption key \"WHATswrongwithUu.\" NGLite abuses NKN infrastructure to facilitate its C2 communication. It identifies the victim system's MAC and IPv4 addresses to establish a unique victim identifier. Additionally, NGLite executes the \"whoami\" command to collect system information and transmit it back to the C2 server.\"\n\nIdentify techniques:\n\n- Command and control channel using HTTP POST over TCP port 30003: Application Layer Protocol (T1071) maybe? Actually T1071 is \"Application Layer Protocol\". Also \"Non-Application Layer Protocol\" T1095? But they use HTTP POST, which is application layer. So T1071.\n\n- Use of encrypted channel for C2: \"Encrypted Channel\" T1573 (Encrypted Channel). Also \"Data Encrypted for Impact\" T1486? No that's for impact. So T1573.\n\n- Use of novel C2 channel leveraging decentralized network: Could be \"Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol\" T1048? Not exactly. It's C2, not exfil. Could be \"Proxy\" T1090? Not exactly. Might be \"Network Service Discovery\"? No. The technique \"Use of Non-Standard Port\" T1571? They use TCP port 30003, which is non-standard. So T1571.\n\n- Identify victim's MAC and IPv4 addresses to establish unique identifier: That's \"System Network Configuration Discovery\" T1016 (System Network Configuration Discovery) or \"Network Share Discovery\"? Actually MAC address is part of network configuration. So T1016.\n\n- Execute \"whoami\" command to collect system information: That's \"System Information Discovery\" T1082 (System Information Discovery) or \"Account Discovery\" T1087? whoami returns current user name, which is system owner/user discovery (T1033) or \"Account Discovery\". The technique \"System Owner/User Discovery\" T1033. Also \"Account Discovery\" T1087 is about enumerating accounts. whoami reveals current user, so T1033.\n\n- Backdoor Trojan designed to execute commands received through its C2 channel: \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" T1059? Actually executing commands is part of \"Command Execution\". Could be \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" T1059. Also \"Remote Services\" maybe? But it's local execution of commands from C2. So T1059.\n\n- \"Backdoor\" typical capabilities: maybe \"Remote Access Software\" T1219? But not described.\n\n- \"Abuses NKN infrastructure to facilitate its C2 communication\": Could be \"Exploitation of Public-Facing Application\"? No. Might be \"Use of External Remote Services\" T1133? Not exactly.\n\n- \"Beaconing\" is part of \"Ingress Tool Transfer\"? Not.\n\n- \"C2 channel that leverages decentralized network\" could be \"Network Service Discovery\"? Not.\n\n- \"HTTP POST request\" also could be \"Web Service\" T1102? Actually T1102 is \"Web Service\". But they use HTTP POST to NKN network, which is a protocol. Could be \"Web Service\" but not necessarily.\n\n- \"AES-encrypted channel\" is encryption for C2: T1573.\n\n- \"Identify victim system's MAC and IPv4 addresses\": T1016.\n\n- \"Collect system information\" via whoami: T1082 (system info) and T1033 (owner/user discovery). The text says \"collect system information\" but specifically whoami. So we can map to T1033.\n\n- \"Transmit it back to the C2 server\": Data exfil? That's \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" T1041. But they send system info back via C2. That is exfiltration over C2 channel. So T1041.\n\n- \"Backdoor Trojan designed to execute commands received through its C2 channel\": Could be \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" T1059.\n\n- \"Uses AES-encrypted channel for C2 communication\": T1573.\n\n- \"Beacon to NKN network via HTTP POST request over TCP port 30003\": T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) and T1571 (Non-Standard Port). Also maybe T1090 (Proxy) but not.\n\nThus list of techniques: T1071, T1573, T1571, T1016, T1033, T1059, T1041, T1082? Might include T1082 if we consider system info discovery beyond whoami. The text says \"collect system information\". That could be T1082. So include T1082.\n\nNow we need to map each to ID and provide reasoning.\n\nFinally final line: IDs for main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs. All are main IDs (no subtech). So list: T1071, T1573, T1571, T1016, T1033, T1059, T1041, T1082.\n\nCheck if any other technique: \"Abuses NKN infrastructure\" maybe \"Exploitation for Defense Evasion\"? No.\n\nThus final answer.\n\nWe must ensure we only output final line with IDs. Provide reasoning before that.\n\nLet's craft answer.",

Need to identify which techniques are described in the text.\n\nText: \"NGLite is a backdoor Trojan designed to execute commands received through its command and control (C2) channel. While its capabilities are typical for a backdoor, NGLite stands out for using a novel C2 channel that leverages a decentralized network based on the legitimate NKN (New Kind of Network) protocol for communication between the backdoor and threat actors.

It identifies the victim system's MAC and IPv4 addresses to establish a unique victim identifier. Additionally, NGLite executes the \"whoami\" command to collect system information and transmit it back to the C2 server.\"\n\nIdentify techniques:\n\n- Command and control channel using HTTP POST over TCP port 30003: Application Layer Protocol (T1071) maybe? Actually T1071 is \"Application Layer Protocol\". Also \"Non-Application Layer Protocol\" T1095? But they use HTTP POST, which is application layer. So T1071.\n\n- Use of encrypted channel for C2: \"Encrypted Channel\" T1573 (Encrypted Channel). Also \"Data Encrypted for Impact\" T1486? No that's for impact. So T1573.\n\n- Use of novel C2 channel leveraging decentralized network: Could be \"Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol\" T1048? Not exactly. It's C2, not exfil. Could be \"Proxy\" T1090? Not exactly. Might be \"Network Service Discovery\"? No. The technique \"Use of Non-Standard Port\" T1571? They use TCP port 30003, which is non-standard. So T1571.\n\n- Identify victim's MAC and IPv4 addresses to establish unique identifier: That's \"System Network Configuration Discovery\" T1016 (System Network Configuration Discovery) or \"Network Share Discovery\"? Actually MAC address is part of network configuration. So T1016.\n\n- Execute \"whoami\" command to collect system information: That's \"System Information Discovery\" T1082 (System Information Discovery) or \"Account Discovery\" T1087? whoami returns current user name, which is system owner/user discovery (T1033) or \"Account Discovery\". The technique \"System Owner/User Discovery\" T1033. Also \"Account Discovery\" T1087 is about enumerating accounts. whoami reveals current user, so T1033.\n\n- Backdoor Trojan designed to execute commands received through its C2 channel: \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" T1059? Actually executing commands is part of \"Command Execution\". Could be \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" T1059. Also \"Remote Services\" maybe? But it's local execution of commands from C2. So T1059.\n\n- \"Backdoor\" typical capabilities: maybe \"Remote Access Software\" T1219? But not described.\n\n- \"Abuses NKN infrastructure to facilitate its C2 communication\": Could be \"Exploitation of Public-Facing Application\"? No. Might be \"Use of External Remote Services\" T1133? Not exactly.\n\n- \"Beaconing\" is part of \"Ingress Tool Transfer\"? Not.\n\n- \"C2 channel that leverages decentralized network\" could be \"Network Service Discovery\"? Not.\n\n- \"HTTP POST request\" also could be \"Web Service\" T1102? Actually T1102 is \"Web Service\". But they use HTTP POST to NKN network, which is a protocol. Could be \"Web Service\" but not necessarily.\n\n- \"AES-encrypted channel\" is encryption for C2: T1573.\n\n- \"Identify victim system's MAC and IPv4 addresses\": T1016.\n\n- \"Collect system information\" via whoami: T1082 (system info) and T1033 (owner/user discovery). The text says \"collect system information\" but specifically whoami. So we can map to T1033.\n\n- \"Transmit it back to the C2 server\": Data exfil? That's \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" T1041. But they send system info back via C2. That is exfiltration over C2 channel. So T1041.\n\n- \"Backdoor Trojan designed to execute commands received through its C2 channel\": Could be \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" T1059.\n\n- \"Uses AES-encrypted channel for C2 communication\": T1573.\n\n- \"Beacon to NKN network via HTTP POST request over TCP port 30003\": T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) and T1571 (Non-Standard Port). Also maybe T1090 (Proxy) but not.\n\nThus list of techniques: T1071, T1573, T1571, T1016, T1033, T1059, T1041, T1082? Might include T1082 if we consider system info discovery beyond whoami. The text says \"collect system information\". That could be T1082. So include T1082.\n\nNow we need to map each to ID and provide reasoning.\n\nFinally final line: IDs for main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs. All are main IDs (no subtech). So list: T1071, T1573, T1571, T1016, T1033, T1059, T1041, T1082.\n\nCheck if any other technique: \"Abuses NKN infrastructure\" maybe \"Exploitation for Defense Evasion\"? No.\n\nThus final answer.\n\nWe must ensure we only output final line with IDs. Provide reasoning before that.\n\nLet's craft answer.",

It has been used in global attacks across various sectors, primarily gaining initial access through drive-by downloads disguised as software updates. Operated by Mustard Tempest, SocGholish’s access has been sold to groups like Indrik Spider for deploying secondary payloads, including remote access Trojans (RATs) and ransomware. SocGholish is executed as a JavaScript payload and can write the output of the `whoami` command to a local temp file using the naming convention `rad<5-hex-chars>.tmp`. It profiles compromised systems to identify domain trust relationships and is often distributed through compromised websites that present malicious content as browser updates.  The malware can exfiltrate data directly to its command and control (C2) server via HTTP and is capable of downloading additional malware onto infected hosts. SocGholish has been named `AutoUpdater.js` to mimic legitimate update files and is frequently delivered within compressed ZIP archives. It also employs single or double Base64 encoding for references to its second-stage server URLs. Additionally, SocGholish has been spread via emails containing malicious links.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1134 : Access

Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** SocGholish is a JavaScript-based loader malware that has been active since at least 2017. It has been used in global attacks across various sectors, primarily gaining initial access through drive-by downloads disguised as software updates. Operated by Mustard Tempest, SocGholish’s access has been sold to groups like Indrik Spider for deploying secondary payloads, including remote access Trojans (RATs) and ransomware. SocGholish is executed as a JavaScript payload and can write the output of the `whoami` command to a local temp file using the naming convention `rad<5-hex-chars>.tmp`. It profiles compromised systems to identify domain trust relationships and is often distributed through compromised websites that present malicious content as browser updates.  The malware can exfiltrate data directly to its command and control (C2) server via HTTP and is capable of downloading additional malware onto infected hosts. SocGholish has been named `AutoUpdater.js` to mimic legitimate update files and is frequently delivered within compressed ZIP archives. It also employs single or double Base64 encoding for references to its second-stage server URLs. Additionally, SocGholish has been spread via emails containing malicious links.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1134 : Access

SocGholish is executed as a JavaScript payload and can write the output of the `whoami` command to a local temp file using the naming convention `rad<5-hex-chars>.tmp`. It profiles compromised systems to identify domain trust relationships and is often distributed through compromised websites that present malicious content as browser updates.  The malware can exfiltrate data directly to its command and control (C2) server via HTTP and is capable of downloading additional malware onto infected hosts. SocGholish has been named `AutoUpdater.js` to mimic legitimate update files and is frequently delivered within compressed ZIP archives.

It has been used in global attacks across various sectors, primarily gaining initial access through drive-by downloads disguised as software updates. Operated by Mustard Tempest, SocGholish’s access has been sold to groups like Indrik Spider for deploying secondary payloads, including remote access Trojans (RATs) and ransomware. SocGholish is executed as a JavaScript payload and can write the output of the `whoami` command to a local temp file using the naming convention `rad<5-hex-chars>.tmp`. It profiles compromised systems to identify domain trust relationships and is often distributed through compromised websites that present malicious content as browser updates.  The malware can exfiltrate data directly to its command and control (C2) server via HTTP and is capable of downloading additional malware onto infected hosts. SocGholish has been named `AutoUpdater.js` to mimic legitimate update files and is frequently delivered within compressed ZIP archives. It also employs single or double Base64 encoding for references to its second-stage server URLs. Additionally, SocGholish has been spread via emails containing malicious links.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism T1134 : Access

        "a95649e45235e382a73ed1f5616b32fd": "We need to extract MITRE Enterprise attack patterns (techniques) from the text, map to IDs, provide reasoning, and final line only IDs for main techniques (excluding subtechnique IDs). The list includes many IDs. We need to identify which techniques are described in the text.\n\nLet's parse the text:\n\n- SocGholish is a JavaScript-based loader malware, initial access through drive-by downloads disguised as software updates. That's \"Drive-by Compromise\" (T1189). Also \"Masquerading\" (T1036) because mimics legitimate update files. Also \"Phishing\" via emails containing malicious links (T1566). Also \"User Execution\" (T1204) maybe because victim runs the malicious JS? Could be \"Exploitation for Client Execution\" (T1203) as drive-by download exploits browser. But the text says \"drive-by downloads disguised as software updates\". That's \"Drive-by Compromise\" (T1189). Also \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) due to Base64 encoding. Also \"Archive Collected Data\" (T1560) maybe not. It writes output of whoami to a temp file; that's \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\"? Actually writes to local file: maybe \"Data Staged\" (T1074) or \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) later. It profiles compromised systems to identify domain trust relationships: that's \"Domain Trust Discovery\" (T1482). Also \"System Information Discovery\" (T1082) maybe. Also \"Network Service Discovery\" (T1046) maybe. Also \"System Owner/User Discovery\" (T1033) via whoami. Also \"File and Directory Discovery\" (T1083) maybe.\n\n- It can exfiltrate data directly to its C2 server via HTTP: that's \"Exfiltration Over Web Service\" (T1567) or \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041). Since HTTP is a web protocol, could be \"Exfiltration Over Web Service\". Also \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) for C2 communications.\n\n- Capable of downloading additional malware onto infected hosts: \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1105) or \"Remote File Copy\"? Not in list. In MITRE, \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" is T1105. So include.\n\n- Delivered within compressed ZIP archives: \"Archive Collected Data\" (T1560) maybe but that's about archiving data for exfil. Could be \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" again. Not sure.\n\n- Uses Base64 encoding for references to second-stage server URLs: \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) or \"Data Encoding\" (T1132). Base64 is encoding. So include T1132.\n\n- Spread via emails containing malicious links: \"Phishing\" (T1566) or \"Spearphishing Link\" (subtechnique). Main technique is Phishing.\n\n- Also \"Masquerading\" (T1036) as named AutoUpdater.js.\n\n- \"Drive-by Compromise\" (T1189) as initial access.\n\n- \"Domain Trust Discovery\" (T1482) for profiling.\n\n- \"System Owner/User Discovery\" (T1033) via whoami.\n\n- \"Exfiltration Over Web Service\" (T1567) or \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041). The text says exfiltrate data directly to its C2 server via HTTP. That's \"Exfiltration Over Web Service\" (T1567) is about using web services like HTTP, but also \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) is generic. We'll pick T1041 maybe. But T1041 is \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\". Since they use HTTP to C2, that qualifies.\n\n- \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) for C2 communications over HTTP.\n\n- \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1105) for downloading additional malware.\n\n- \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) for Base64 encoding.\n\n- \"Data Encoding\" (T1132) also.\n\n- \"Masquerading\" (T1036) for naming.\n\n- \"Phishing\" (T1566) for email links.\n\n- \"Drive-by Compromise\" (T1189) for initial access.\n\n- \"User Execution\" (T1204) maybe but not explicit.\n\n- \"Browser Information Discovery\" (T1217) maybe for profiling domain trust relationships? Actually domain trust discovery is T1482. Browser info maybe not.\n\n- \"Network Service Discovery\" (T1046) maybe not described.\n\n- \"System Information Discovery\" (T1082) maybe.\n\n- \"File and Directory Discovery\" (T1083) maybe not.\n\n- \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) because JavaScript executed? Could be.\n\n- \"Execution Guardrails\" (T1480) not.\n\n- \"Masquerading\" definitely.\n\n- \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" definitely.\n\n- \"Data Encoding\" definitely.\n\n- \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" definitely.\n\n- \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" definitely.\n\n- \"Application Layer Protocol\" definitely.\n\n- \"Drive-by Compromise\" definitely.\n\n- \"Phishing\" definitely.\n\n- \"Domain Trust Discovery\" definitely.\n\n- \"System Owner/User Discovery\" definitely.\n\n- \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" maybe because uses JavaScript.\n\n- \"Browser Information Discovery\" maybe not.\n\n- \"System Information Discovery\" maybe.\n\nWe need to map each identified technique to ID from list.\n\nLet's list IDs:\n\n- T1189 : Drive-by Compromise\n- T1036 : Masquerading\n- T1566 : Phishing\n- T1482 : Domain Trust Discovery\n- T1033 : System Owner/User Discovery\n- T1041 : Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\n- T1071 : Application Layer Protocol\n- T1105 : Ingress Tool Transfer\n- T1027 : Obfuscated Files or Information\n- T1132 : Data Encoding\n- T1059 : Command and Scripting Interpreter\n- T1082 : System Information Discovery (maybe)\n- T1083 : File and Directory Discovery (maybe)\n- T1046 : Network Service Discovery (maybe)\n- T1204 : User Execution (maybe)\n\nWe need to provide reasoning for each identification.\n\nBut final line should contain only IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. Main techniques are those we identified as primary. Should we include all? Probably include those clearly described. Let's include: T1189, T1036, T1566, T1482, T1033, T1041, T1071, T1105, T1027, T1132, T1059. Possibly also T1082. But we need to decide which are main. The text mentions profiling compromised systems to identify domain trust relationships (Domain Trust Discovery). It also mentions writing whoami output to a temp file (System Owner/User Discovery). It mentions exfiltration via HTTP (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel). It mentions downloading additional malware (Ingress Tool Transfer). It mentions Base64 encoding (Obfuscated Files or Information, Data Encoding). It mentions masquerading as AutoUpdater.js (Masquerading). It mentions drive-by downloads disguised as software updates (Drive-by Compromise). It mentions spread via emails containing malicious links (Phishing). It mentions JavaScript payload execution (Command and Scripting Interpreter). It mentions using HTTP (Application Layer Protocol). So include all those.\n\nThus final IDs: T1189, T1036, T1566, T1482, T1033, T1041, T1071, T1105, T1027, T1132, T1059.\n\nProvide reasoning for each.\n\nNow produce answer.",

Actually call logs is maybe \"Call Control\" (T1616) is about controlling calls? Or \"Call Log\" maybe part of \"Audio Capture\"? Not sure. There's \"Call Control\" technique ID T1616. That seems about controlling calls (e.g., making calls). But retrieving call logs maybe \"Call Log\" is not listed. Could be \"Credentials from Password Store\"? No. Maybe \"SMS Control\" T1582 is about SMS messages. Retrieve SMS messages -> SMS Control (T1582). Retrieve contact lists -> maybe \"Credentials from Password Store\"? Not. Could be \"Stored Application Data\" T1409? Contact lists stored? Or \"Data from Local System\" T1533? That is generic data collection. But we have specific technique \"Location Tracking\" T1430, \"Audio Capture\" T1429 for microphone, \"Video Capture\" T1512 for camera, \"SMS Control\" T1582 for SMS messages, \"Call Control\" T1616 for call logs? Actually call logs maybe \"Call Control\" is about controlling calls, not logs. But we can map to \"Call Control\" as retrieving call logs? Might be \"Call Control\" includes call logs. We'll include.\n\nAlso \"access and extract files stored on the device\" -> \"Data from Local System\" T1533 (collect files). Also \"Remote Access Software\" T1663 (since it's remote access RAT). Also \"Remote Access Software\" is a technique.\n\nAlso \"Activate camera and microphone\" -> \"Audio Capture\" T1429, \"Video Capture\" T1512.\n\nAlso \"Collect various types of data\" generic \"Data from Local System\" T1533.\n\nThus list of identified techniques:\n\n- T1430 Location Tracking\n- T1429 Audio Capture\n- T1512 Video Capture\n- T1582 SMS Control\n- T1616 Call Control (maybe)\n- T1533 Data from Local System\n- T1663 Remote Access Software\n\nAlso maybe \"Access notifications\"? Not mentioned. \"Clipboard Data\"? Not.\n\nNow we need to provide reasoning for each identification.\n\nFinally final line: IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. All are main IDs.

Then final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. The list given includes only main technique IDs (no subtechnique). So we need to identify which techniques are described in the text.\n\nText: \"HilalRAT is a remote access Android malware developed and used by UNC788. It has the capability to collect various types of data, such as device location and call logs, and can perform actions like activating a device's camera and microphone. HilalRAT can activate a device's microphone and camera, access its location, retrieve contact lists and SMS messages, and access and extract files stored on the device.\"\n\nSo capabilities:\n\n- Collect device location -> Location Tracking (T1430)\n- Collect call logs -> Call Control? Actually call logs is maybe \"Call Control\" (T1616) is about controlling calls? Or \"Call Log\" maybe part of \"Audio Capture\"? Not sure. There's \"Call Control\" technique ID T1616. That seems about controlling calls (e.g., making calls). But retrieving call logs maybe \"Call Log\" is not listed. Could be \"Credentials from Password Store\"? No. Maybe \"SMS Control\" T1582 is about SMS messages. Retrieve SMS messages -> SMS Control (T1582). Retrieve contact lists -> maybe \"Credentials from Password Store\"? Not. Could be \"Stored Application Data\" T1409? Contact lists stored? Or \"Data from Local System\" T1533? That is generic data collection. But we have specific technique \"Location Tracking\" T1430, \"Audio Capture\" T1429 for microphone, \"Video Capture\" T1512 for camera, \"SMS Control\" T1582 for SMS messages, \"Call Control\" T1616 for call logs? Actually call logs maybe \"Call Control\" is about controlling calls, not logs. But we can map to \"Call Control\" as retrieving call logs? Might be \"Call Control\" includes call logs. We'll include.\n\nAlso \"access and extract files stored on the device\" -> \"Data from Local System\" T1533 (collect files). Also \"Remote Access Software\" T1663 (since it's remote access RAT). Also \"Remote Access Software\" is a technique.\n\nAlso \"Activate camera and microphone\" -> \"Audio Capture\" T1429, \"Video Capture\" T1512.\n\nAlso \"Collect various types of data\" generic \"Data from Local System\" T1533.\n\nThus list of identified techniques:\n\n- T1430 Location Tracking\n- T1429 Audio Capture\n- T1512 Video Capture\n- T1582 SMS Control\n- T1616 Call Control (maybe)\n- T1533 Data from Local System\n- T1663 Remote Access Software\n\nAlso maybe \"Access notifications\"? Not mentioned. \"Clipboard Data\"? Not.\n\nNow we need to provide reasoning for each identification.\n\nFinally final line: IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. All are main IDs. So list: T1430, T1429, T1512, T1582, T1616, T1533, T1663\n\nMake sure order maybe as they appear.\n\nNow produce answer.",

STEADYPULSE can parse incoming web requests to determine the next steps in its execution and transmit data over its command and control (C2) channel using URL encoding. It is also capable of URL decoding key/value pairs received over C2. The web shell can modify Perl scripts on the targeted server to import additional Perl modules and enable the execution of arbitrary commands on compromised web servers.\"\n\nIdentify techniques:\n\n- Web shell modifies legitimate Perl script => \"Modify Existing Service\"? Actually modifying scripts to import modules and execute arbitrary commands is \"Modify Existing Scripts\" maybe \"Modify Existing System Process\" (T1543) or \"Modify Existing Files\"? There's technique \"Modify Existing System Process\" T1543. But more specific: \"Modify Existing Scripts\" is subtechnique T1059.001? Actually T1059 is Command and Scripting Interpreter. Subtechnique .001 is PowerShell, .003 is Windows Command Shell, .006 is JavaScript, .007 is Visual Basic, .008 is Python, .009 is Unix Shell, .010 is AppleScript, .011 is Network Device CLI, .012 is Windows Registry, .013 is Cloud Shell. Not relevant.\n\nBut \"Modify Existing Scripts\" is T1059? Not exactly. There's technique \"Modify Existing Service\" T1543.003? Actually T1543 is Create or Modify System Process. Subtechnique .003 is Windows Service, .004 is Launch Agent, .005 is Systemd Service, .006 is Kernel Module, .007 is Container, .008 is . Not script.\n\nMaybe \"Modify Existing Scripts\" is T1064? That's deprecated. Could be \"Modify Existing Files\" T1565? Data Manipulation? Not.\n\nBetter: \"Modify Perl scripts on the targeted server to import additional Perl modules and enable the execution of arbitrary commands\" => This is \"Modify Existing Files\" which is part of \"Modify Existing System Process\"? Not.\n\nBut there is technique \"Modify Existing System Process\" (T1543) which includes modifying scripts that are used to start processes. Could be.\n\nAlso \"Web shell can parse incoming web requests to determine next steps\" => This is \"Command and Control: Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) maybe \"Web Shell\" is a type of \"Web Service\" (T1102) for C2. It transmits data over C2 channel using URL encoding => \"Data Encoding\" (T1132). Also \"URL decoding key/value pairs received over C2\" => also Data Encoding.\n\n\"Transmit data over its command and control (C2) channel using URL encoding\" => \"Exfiltration Over Web Service\"? Actually using URL encoding for C2 is \"Web Protocols\" maybe \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071). Also \"Web Shell\" is a \"Web Service\" (T1102) for C2.\n\n\"Modify Perl scripts on the targeted server to import additional Perl modules and enable the execution of arbitrary commands on compromised web servers.\" => This is \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) because they use Perl to execute commands. Also \"Modify Existing Scripts\" could be \"Modify Existing System Process\" (T1543) but not sure.\n\nAlso \"targets Pulse Secure VPN servers by modifying a legitimate Perl script.\" => This is \"Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\"? Not. It's \"Exploitation for Defense Evasion\"? Not.\n\nCould be \"Exploitation for Client Execution\" (T1203) but they modify a script on server, not exploit.\n\nMaybe \"Modify Existing Files\" is \"Modify Registry\"? No.\n\nLet's list likely techniques:\n\n- T1071: Application Layer Protocol (C2 using URL encoding)\n- T1102: Web Service (web shell C2)\n- T1132: Data Encoding (URL encoding/decoding)\n- T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter (Perl script execution)\n- T1543: Create or Modify System Process (modifying legitimate script to execute arbitrary commands) maybe.\n- T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application (targeting VPN servers) but they modify script, not exploit. Could be \"Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\" (T1068) but not.\n\nAlso \"Web shell\" is a \"Web Shell\" technique: T1100? Actually MITRE has \"Web Shell\" as subtechnique of \"Command and Control: Web Shell\" T1100? Wait there is technique \"Web Shell\" T1100? In ATT&CK, \"Web Shell\" is T1100 (deprecated) now T1059? Actually there is \"Web Shell\" T1100 in older version. In current ATT&CK, \"Web Shell\" is T1100? Let's recall: T1100 is \"Web Shell\". Yes, it's a technique. So we can map to T1100 if present in list? Not in provided list. The list does not include T1100. So maybe we ignore.\n\nBut we need to map only from given list. The list includes many IDs but not T1100. So we cannot use it.\n\nThus we choose those present.\n\nCheck list for T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) present. T1102 present. T1132 present. T1059 present. T1543 present. Also T1190 present (Exploit Public-Facing Application). Could be relevant: targeting VPN servers (public-facing). So include T1190.\n\nNow we need to provide reasoning for each identification.\n\nFinally final line: IDs for main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs. So list: T1071, T1102, T1132, T1059, T1543, T1190.\n\nMake sure order maybe as they appear.\n\nNow produce answer with reasoning and final line.",

It has been used since at least 2020, including in attacks against U.S. Defense Industrial Base (DIB) entities. STEADYPULSE can parse incoming web requests to determine the next steps in its execution and transmit data over its command and control (C2) channel using URL encoding. It is also capable of URL decoding key/value pairs received over C2. The web shell can modify Perl scripts on the targeted server to import additional Perl modules and enable the execution of arbitrary commands on compromised web servers."

This matches the “Web Service” technique for C2. |\n| **T1132 – Data Encoding** | The shell “uses URL encoding” to send data and “is also capable of URL decoding key/value pairs received over C2.”  URL encoding is a form of data encoding used to hide or transform the payload. |\n| **T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter** | STEADYPULSE “modifies a legitimate Perl script” and “enables the execution of arbitrary commands on compromised web servers.”  Leveraging Perl (a scripting language) to run commands is a direct use of the Command and Scripting Interpreter technique. |\n| **T1543 – Create or Modify System Process** | By “modifying a legitimate Perl script” the adversary changes the behavior of a server‑side script so that it can launch arbitrary commands.  This is a modification of an existing system process (the script) to achieve persistent or on‑demand execution. |\n| **T1190 – Exploit Public‑Facing Application** | The payload “targets Pulse Secure VPN servers,” which are public‑facing services.

It is also capable of URL decoding key/value pairs received over C2. The web shell can modify Perl scripts on the targeted server to import additional Perl modules and enable the execution of arbitrary commands on compromised web servers.\"\n\nIdentify techniques:\n\n- Web shell modifies legitimate Perl script => \"Modify Existing Service\"? Actually modifying scripts to import modules and execute arbitrary commands is \"Modify Existing Scripts\" maybe \"Modify Existing System Process\" (T1543) or \"Modify Existing Files\"? There's technique \"Modify Existing System Process\" T1543. But more specific: \"Modify Existing Scripts\" is subtechnique T1059.001? Actually T1059 is Command and Scripting Interpreter. Subtechnique .001 is PowerShell, .003 is Windows Command Shell, .006 is JavaScript, .007 is Visual Basic, .008 is Python, .009 is Unix Shell, .010 is AppleScript, .011 is Network Device CLI, .012 is Windows Registry, .013 is Cloud Shell. Not relevant.\n\nBut \"Modify Existing Scripts\" is T1059? Not exactly. There's technique \"Modify Existing Service\" T1543.003? Actually T1543 is Create or Modify System Process. Subtechnique .003 is Windows Service, .004 is Launch Agent, .005 is Systemd Service, .006 is Kernel Module, .007 is Container, .008 is . Not script.\n\nMaybe \"Modify Existing Scripts\" is T1064? That's deprecated. Could be \"Modify Existing Files\" T1565? Data Manipulation? Not.\n\nBetter: \"Modify Perl scripts on the targeted server to import additional Perl modules and enable the execution of arbitrary commands\" => This is \"Modify Existing Files\" which is part of \"Modify Existing System Process\"? Not.\n\nBut there is technique \"Modify Existing System Process\" (T1543) which includes modifying scripts that are used to start processes. Could be.\n\nAlso \"Web shell can parse incoming web requests to determine next steps\" => This is \"Command and Control: Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) maybe \"Web Shell\" is a type of \"Web Service\" (T1102) for C2. It transmits data over C2 channel using URL encoding => \"Data Encoding\" (T1132). Also \"URL decoding key/value pairs received over C2\" => also Data Encoding.\n\n\"Transmit data over its command and control (C2) channel using URL encoding\" => \"Exfiltration Over Web Service\"? Actually using URL encoding for C2 is \"Web Protocols\" maybe \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071). Also \"Web Shell\" is a \"Web Service\" (T1102) for C2.\n\n\"Modify Perl scripts on the targeted server to import additional Perl modules and enable the execution of arbitrary commands on compromised web servers.\" => This is \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) because they use Perl to execute commands. Also \"Modify Existing Scripts\" could be \"Modify Existing System Process\" (T1543) but not sure.\n\nAlso \"targets Pulse Secure VPN servers by modifying a legitimate Perl script.\" => This is \"Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\"? Not. It's \"Exploitation for Defense Evasion\"? Not.\n\nCould be \"Exploitation for Client Execution\" (T1203) but they modify a script on server, not exploit.\n\nMaybe \"Modify Existing Files\" is \"Modify Registry\"? No.\n\nLet's list likely techniques:\n\n- T1071: Application Layer Protocol (C2 using URL encoding)\n- T1102: Web Service (web shell C2)\n- T1132: Data Encoding (URL encoding/decoding)\n- T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter (Perl script execution)\n- T1543: Create or Modify System Process (modifying legitimate script to execute arbitrary commands) maybe.\n- T1190: Exploit Public-Facing Application (targeting VPN servers) but they modify script, not exploit. Could be \"Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\" (T1068) but not.\n\nAlso \"Web shell\" is a \"Web Shell\" technique: T1100? Actually MITRE has \"Web Shell\" as subtechnique of \"Command and Control: Web Shell\" T1100? Wait there is technique \"Web Shell\" T1100? In ATT&CK, \"Web Shell\" is T1100 (deprecated) now T1059? Actually there is \"Web Shell\" T1100 in older version. In current ATT&CK, \"Web Shell\" is T1100? Let's recall: T1100 is \"Web Shell\". Yes, it's a technique. So we can map to T1100 if present in list? Not in provided list. The list does not include T1100. So maybe we ignore.\n\nBut we need to map only from given list. The list includes many IDs but not T1100. So we cannot use it.\n\nThus we choose those present.\n\nCheck list for T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) present. T1102 present. T1132 present. T1059 present. T1543 present. Also T1190 present (Exploit Public-Facing Application). Could be relevant: targeting VPN servers (public-facing). So include T1190.\n\nNow we need to provide reasoning for each identification.\n\nFinally final line: IDs for main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs. So list: T1071, T1102, T1132, T1059, T1543, T1190.\n\nMake sure order maybe as they appear.\n\nNow produce answer with reasoning and final line.",

Using HTTP as the transport layer for command‑and‑control fits the “Application Layer Protocol” technique. |\n| **T1102** | Web Service | Communication is performed through HTTP POST requests to a web‑service endpoint (the DSID cookie and POST body). This matches the “Web Service” technique for C2. |\n| **T1027** | Obfuscated Files or Information | FRAMESTING compresses (zlib) the data it sends and receives. Compression is a form of obfuscation used to hide the true content of the C2 traffic. |\n| **T1132** | Data Encoding | The same zlib compression can be viewed as an encoding step applied to the data before it is transmitted, satisfying the “Data Encoding” technique. |\n| **T1574** | Hijack Execution Flow | FRAMESTING “embeds itself into the CAV Python package” so that the malicious code is executed when the legitimate package is loaded.

FRAMESTING can retrieve command and control (C2) instructions from values stored in the DSID cookie of an HTTP request or from decompressed zlib data within the request's POST data. It is specifically designed to embed itself within the CAV Python package of an Ivanti Connect Secure VPN, located at `/home/venv3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/cav-0.1-py3.6.egg/cav/api/resources/category.py`. The web shell can send and receive zlib-compressed data through POST requests and decompress incoming data for processing.

The web shell can send and receive zlib-compressed data through POST requests and decompress incoming data for processing. FRAMESTING enables the execution of arbitrary commands on compromised Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs.\"\n\nWe need to identify attack patterns (techniques) described:\n\n- \"Python-based web shell\" => Use of web shell for command execution. Likely technique: T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) or T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer) maybe. But web shell is a \"Web Shell\" which is a type of \"Web Service\" or \"Web Shell\" is under T1100? Actually MITRE has technique \"Web Shell\" under T1505.003? Not in list. But we have \"Web Service\" T1102? Actually T1102 is \"Web Service\". However the list includes T1102: Web Service. That is about using web services for C2. The text mentions retrieving C2 instructions from cookie and POST data. That's \"Web Shell\" using HTTP for C2. Could map to \"Application Layer Protocol\" T1071 (C2 over HTTP). Also \"Web Service\" T1102 maybe.\n\n- \"Embedding itself into a Python package for command execution\" => \"Modify Existing Service\"? Not exactly. Could be \"Modify Existing Software\" maybe \"Exploitation for Defense Evasion\"? Not. Could be \"Install or Modify System Process\"? Not. Could be \"Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\"? Not. Might be \"T1547: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\"? Not.\n\n- \"Retrieve C2 instructions from values stored in the DSID cookie of an HTTP request\" => This is using cookies for C2. That's \"Web Cookies\" maybe \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\"? Not. Could be \"T1071: Application Layer Protocol\" (HTTP). Also \"T1041: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" but it's inbound.\n\n- \"Decompressed zlib data within POST data\" => Data encoding/compression. That's \"Data Encoding\" T1132 (Data Encoding) or \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" T1027. Since they compress data for C2, that's \"Obfuscated/Compressed Command and Control\". Could map to T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information) or T1132 (Data Encoding). The list includes both.\n\n- \"Send and receive zlib-compressed data through POST requests\" => same.\n\n- \"Enables execution of arbitrary commands\" => \"Command Execution\" T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) or \"T1202: Indirect Command Execution\"? Not.\n\nThus likely techniques:\n\n- T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) – using HTTP for C2.\n- T1102 (Web Service) – using web service (HTTP POST) for C2.\n- T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) – execution of arbitrary commands via web shell.\n- T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information) – using compression (zlib) to hide data.\n- T1132 (Data Encoding) – compression is a form of encoding.\n- Possibly T1547? Not.\n\nAlso \"Embedding into Python package\" could be \"T1574: Hijack Execution Flow\" (e.g., hijack a legitimate package). Or \"T1546: Event Triggered Execution\"? Not.\n\nBut MITRE has technique \"T1574.001: DLL Search Order Hijacking\" etc. Not in list. However \"Hijack Execution Flow\" is T1574. So we could map embedding into a Python package as hijacking execution flow of the package. So include T1574.\n\nAlso \"Web Shell\" is a type of \"T1100\"? Not in list. But \"Web Shell\" is under \"T1505.003: Web Shell\". Not in list. So we ignore.\n\nThus list of identified techniques: T1071, T1102, T1059, T1027, T1132, T1574.\n\nNow we need to provide reasoning for each identification.\n\nFinally final line: IDs for main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs. All are main IDs (no subtech). So final line: T1071, T1102, T1059, T1027, T1132, T1574\n\nCheck if any duplicates.\n\nNow produce answer.",

Using HTTP as the transport layer for command‑and‑control fits the “Application Layer Protocol” technique. |\n| **T1102** | Web Service | Communication is performed through HTTP POST requests to a web‑service endpoint (the DSID cookie and POST body). This matches the “Web Service” technique for C2. |\n| **T1027** | Obfuscated Files or Information | FRAMESTING compresses (zlib) the data it sends and receives. Compression is a form of obfuscation used to hide the true content of the C2 traffic. |\n| **T1132** | Data Encoding | The same zlib compression can be viewed as an encoding step applied to the data before it is transmitted, satisfying the “Data Encoding” technique. |\n| **T1574** | Hijack Execution Flow | FRAMESTING “embeds itself into the CAV Python package” so that the malicious code is executed when the legitimate package is loaded.

It decodes configuration items from a bundled file to facilitate C2 activity and connects to the C2 infrastructure using SSL. The malware is installed after exploiting a vulnerable FortiGate device and surveys the contents of system files during installation. COATHANGER sets the GID of `httpsd` to 90 upon infection, installs itself into a hidden directory, and removes and writes malicious shared objects that replace legitimate system functions such as

Also \"Scheduled Task/Job\" maybe? Daemon for timed check-ins could be \"Scheduled Task/Job\" (T1053) but daemon is a service. Could be \"Create or Modify System Process\". Also \"Remote Services\" (T1021) for reverse shell? Not exactly.\n\n- Decodes configuration items from bundled file to facilitate C2 activity. => \"Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\" (T1140) maybe.\n\n- Connects to C2 infrastructure using SSL. => Encrypted Channel again.\n\n- Malware installed after exploiting a vulnerable FortiGate device. => \"Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\"? Actually exploiting vulnerable device is \"Exploitation for Client Execution\" (T1203) or \"Exploitation of Remote Services\" (T1210) or \"Exploit Public-Facing Application\" (T1190) if remote service. FortiGate is network device; exploitation of remote services (T1210) fits.\n\n- Surveys the contents of system files during installation. => \"File and Directory Discovery\" (T1083) or \"System Information Discovery\"? System files: \"File and Directory Discovery\".\n\n- Sets GID of httpsd to 90 upon infection, installs itself into a hidden directory, and removes and writes malicious shared objects that replace legitimate system",

The list includes many IDs. We need to identify which techniques are described.\n\nText summary:\n\n- Remote access tool (RAT) targeting FortiGate appliances.\n- Uses HTTP GET request to establish follow-on TLS tunnel for C2 communication. => Use of Application Layer Protocol (T1071) maybe \"Web Protocols\"? Actually T1071 is \"Application Layer Protocol\". Also \"Protocol Tunneling\" (T1572) maybe? The text says \"establish a follow-on TLS tunnel\". That's \"Protocol Tunneling\" (T1572). Also \"Encrypted Channel\" (T1573) maybe? TLS tunnel is encrypted channel. Could be T1573 \"Encrypted Channel\". Also \"Proxy\" maybe? Not mentioned.\n\n- Provides BusyBox reverse shell for C2 operations and creates a daemon for timed check-ins with C2 infrastructure. => \"Create or Modify System Process\" (T1543) for daemon. Also \"Scheduled Task/Job\" maybe? Daemon for timed check-ins could be \"Scheduled Task/Job\" (T1053) but daemon is a service. Could be \"Create or Modify System Process\". Also \"Remote Services\" (T1021) for reverse shell? Not exactly.\n\n- Decodes configuration items from bundled file to facilitate C2 activity. => \"Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\" (T1140) maybe.\n\n- Connects to C2 infrastructure using SSL. => Encrypted Channel again.\n\n- Malware installed after exploiting a vulnerable FortiGate device. => \"Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\"? Actually exploiting vulnerable device is \"Exploitation for Client Execution\" (T1203) or \"Exploitation of Remote Services\" (T1210) or \"Exploit Public-Facing Application\" (T1190) if remote service. FortiGate is network device; exploitation of remote services (T1210) fits.\n\n- Surveys the contents of system files during installation. => \"File and Directory Discovery\" (T1083) or \"System Information Discovery\"? System files: \"File and Directory Discovery\".\n\n- Sets GID of httpsd to 90 upon infection, installs itself into a hidden directory, and removes and writes malicious shared objects that replace legitimate system",

It was deployed during the Cutting Edge campaign to compromise Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs. WARPWIRE operates as a credential harvester written in JavaScript and can embed itself into legitimate files on compromised Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs. It Base64 encodes captured credentials using `btoa()` before transmitting them to its command and control (C2) server. The stolen credentials are sent via HTTP GET or POST requests. Additionally, WARPWIRE can intercept credentials submitted during the web logon process, enabling access to layer seven applications such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).  **List of All MITRE

MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** WARPWIRE is a JavaScript-based credential stealer that targets plaintext usernames and passwords for exfiltration. It was deployed during the Cutting Edge campaign to compromise Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs. WARPWIRE operates as a credential harvester written in JavaScript and can embed itself into legitimate files on compromised Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs. It Base64 encodes captured credentials using `btoa()` before transmitting them to its command and control (C2) server. The stolen credentials are sent via HTTP GET or POST requests. Additionally, WARPWIRE can intercept credentials submitted during the web logon process, enabling access to layer seven applications such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).  **List of All MITRE

It was deployed during the Cutting Edge campaign to compromise Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs. WARPWIRE operates as a credential harvester written in JavaScript and can embed itself into legitimate files on compromised Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs. It Base64 encodes captured credentials using `btoa()` before transmitting them to its command and control (C2) server. The stolen credentials are sent via HTTP GET or POST requests. Additionally, WARPWIRE can intercept credentials submitted during the web logon process, enabling access to layer seven applications such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)."

The text describes:\n\n- ELF binary targeting modems/routers MIPS.\n- Conducts comprehensive wipe of filesystem and storage devices by overwriting data or using IOCTL commands to erase it.\n- Iterates over device file identifiers, opens device files, overwrites or issues IOCTL commands to remove data.\n- Targets files and directories associated with storage devices.\n- After wiping, reboots system.\n\nSo techniques:\n\n1. Data Destruction (T1485) – wiping filesystem, overwriting, using IOCTL to erase. That's Data Destruction.\n\n2. Disk Wipe (T1561) – specific technique for wiping disks. The list includes T1561: Disk Wipe. So also applicable.\n\n3. Modify System Image? Not exactly. Reboot after wiping maybe \"System Shutdown/Reboot\" (T1529) – reboots system. The text says \"reboots the compromised system\". That's System Shutdown/Reboot.\n\n4. Possibly \"Modify Registry\"? Not mentioned.\n\n5. \"File and Directory Discovery\" (T1083) – they target files and directories, but they are not discovering, they are wiping. Not necessarily.\n\n6. \"Device Driver Discovery\" (T1652) – they iterate over device file identifiers, but that's more about accessing devices, not discovering drivers.\n\n7. \"Exfiltration\"? No.\n\n8. \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\"? Not.\n\n9. \"Obfuscated Files or Information\"? Not.\n\nThus main techniques: T1485, T1561, T1529.\n\nCheck if any other technique: \"Direct Volume Access\" (T1006) – using device files and IOCTL commands to directly access storage. Could be considered Direct Volume Access. The description: \"overwrites data or using various IOCTL commands to erase it.\" That's direct volume access. So T1006.\n\nAlso \"Modify System Image\" (T1601) maybe not.\n\nThus we have multiple possible techniques. Need to map each identified pattern to ID.\n\nProvide reasoning for each.\n\nFinal line: IDs for main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs. All IDs are main (no subtech).

MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** LoFiSe has been used by ToddyCat since at least 2023 to identify and collect files of interest on targeted systems. LoFiSe is capable of collecting files into password-protected ZIP archives for exfiltration. It periodically gathers all files from the working directory every three hours, placing them into a password-protected archive for later extraction. The malware also targets specific files of interest on compromised systems, saving them in the `C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\` and `C:\\Windows\\Temp\\` folders for further evaluation and exfiltration. LoFiSe monitors the file system to identify files smaller than 6.4 MB with extensions such as .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx, .pdf, .rtf, .tif, .odt, .ods, .odp, .eml, and .msg.

Then final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs.\n\nThe text: \"LIGHTWIRE is a Perl-based web shell used during the Cutting Edge campaign to maintain access and enable command execution by embedding itself into the legitimate `compcheckresult.cgi` component of Ivanti Secure Connect VPNs. LIGHTWIRE communicates with its command and control (C2) server over HTTP and can decrypt RC4-encrypted and Base64-decoded C2 commands. It also encrypts C2 commands using RC4. By embedding into the `compcheckresult.cgi` component, LIGHTWIRE facilitates command execution and establishes persistence on compromised Ivanti Secure Connect VPNs.\"\n\nWe need to identify attack patterns (techniques) described:\n\n- Use of web shell (Perl-based) to maintain access and enable command execution. This is \"Web Shell\" which is a technique: T1100? Not in list. But maybe \"Web Shell\" is part of \"Web Service\" or \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\"? Actually MITRE technique for \"Web Shell\" is T1100? Wait T1100 is \"Web Shell\"? In ATT&CK, T1100 is \"Web Shell\". However not in provided list. The list includes many but not T1100. Could be \"Web Shell\" is under \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) or \"Exploitation for Client Execution\"? Not exactly. But we can map to \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) because it's a script that executes commands. Also \"Web Shell\" is a form of \"Web Service\" (T1102) maybe? Actually T1102 is \"Web Service\". But web shell is a malicious web server component used for C2. Could be \"Web Shell\" falls under \"Web Service\" (C2 over HTTP). Also \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) for C2 over HTTP. The text says communicates over HTTP, encrypts commands using RC4, decrypts RC4-encrypted and Base64-decoded commands. That's \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) for encryption/encoding. Also \"Data Encoding\" (T1132) for Base64. \"Encrypted Channel\" (T1573) for RC4 encryption? Actually RC4 encryption of C2 commands is encryption, but not necessarily a channel encryption; it's data encryption. Could be \"Obfuscated Files or Information\". Also \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" for executing commands via web shell. Persistence by embedding into legitimate component: that's \"Modify Existing Service\"? Actually embedding into legitimate component is \"Masquerading\" (T1036) or \"Component Hijacking\" (T1505? Actually T1505 is \"Server Software Component\". The list includes T1505: Server Software Component. That matches embedding into legitimate component to maintain persistence. So T1505.\n\nAlso \"Persistence\" via \"Web Shell\" could be \"Web Shell\" technique T1100 not listed. But we can map to \"Server Software Component\" (T1505) which is about compromising server software components to maintain persistence.\n\nAlso \"Command Execution\" is \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059). Also \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) for C2 over HTTP.\n\nAlso \"Data Encoding\" (T1132) for Base64. \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) for RC4 encryption.\n\nAlso \"Web Service\" (T1102) maybe for using HTTP for C2.\n\nAlso \"Exfiltration Over Web Service\" not present.\n\nThus list of identified techniques: T1059, T1071, T1027, T1132, T1505, T1036 maybe, T1102.\n\nCheck if T1036 (Masquerading) is appropriate: embedding into legitimate component to hide malicious code. Yes.\n\nNow we need to map each to IDs and provide reasoning.\n\nFinally final line: only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. All are main IDs (no subtech). So list: T1059, T1071, T1027, T1132, T1505, T1036, T1102.\n\nBut ensure they are in the provided list. T1102 is present. T1505 is present. T1036 present. Good.\n\nNow produce answer with reasoning for each identification. Then final line with IDs.\n\n",

                  "reasoning": "We need to extract MITRE Enterprise attack patterns from the text and map them to technique IDs. Provide reasoning for each identification. Then final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs.\n\nThe text: \"LIGHTWIRE is a Perl-based web shell used during the Cutting Edge campaign to maintain access and enable command execution by embedding itself into the legitimate `compcheckresult.cgi` component of Ivanti Secure Connect VPNs. LIGHTWIRE communicates with its command and control (C2) server over HTTP and can decrypt RC4-encrypted and Base64-decoded C2 commands. It also encrypts C2 commands using RC4. By embedding into the `compcheckresult.cgi` component, LIGHTWIRE facilitates command execution and establishes persistence on compromised Ivanti Secure Connect VPNs.\"\n\nWe need to identify attack patterns (techniques) described:\n\n- Use of web shell (Perl-based) to maintain access and enable command execution. This is \"Web Shell\" which is a technique: T1100? Not in list. But maybe \"Web Shell\" is part of \"Web Service\" or \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\"? Actually MITRE technique for \"Web Shell\" is T1100? Wait T1100 is \"Web Shell\"? In ATT&CK, T1100 is \"Web Shell\". However not in provided list. The list includes many but not T1100. Could be \"Web Shell\" is under \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) or \"Exploitation for Client Execution\"? Not exactly. But we can map to \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) because it's a script that executes commands. Also \"Web Shell\" is a form of \"Web Service\" (T1102) maybe? Actually T1102 is \"Web Service\". But web shell is a malicious web server component used for C2. Could be \"Web Shell\" falls under \"Web Service\" (C2 over HTTP). Also \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) for C2 over HTTP. The text says communicates over HTTP, encrypts commands using RC4, decrypts RC4-encrypted and Base64-decoded commands. That's \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) for encryption/encoding. Also \"Data Encoding\" (T1132) for Base64. \"Encrypted Channel\" (T1573) for RC4 encryption? Actually RC4 encryption of C2 commands is encryption, but not necessarily a channel encryption; it's data encryption. Could be \"Obfuscated Files or Information\". Also \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" for executing commands via web shell. Persistence by embedding into legitimate component: that's \"Modify Existing Service\"? Actually embedding into legitimate component is \"Masquerading\" (T1036) or \"Component Hijacking\" (T1505? Actually T1505 is \"Server Software Component\". The list includes T1505: Server Software Component. That matches embedding into legitimate component to maintain persistence. So T1505.\n\nAlso \"Persistence\" via \"Web Shell\" could be \"Web Shell\" technique T1100 not listed. But we can map to \"Server Software Component\" (T1505) which is about compromising server software components to maintain persistence.\n\nAlso \"Command Execution\" is \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059). Also \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) for C2 over HTTP.\n\nAlso \"Data Encoding\" (T1132) for Base64. \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) for RC4 encryption.\n\nAlso \"Web Service\" (T1102) maybe for using HTTP for C2.\n\nAlso \"Exfiltration Over Web Service\" not present.\n\nThus list of identified techniques: T1059, T1071, T1027, T1132, T1505, T1036 maybe, T1102.\n\nCheck if T1036 (Masquerading) is appropriate: embedding into legitimate component to hide malicious code. Yes.\n\nNow we need to map each to IDs and provide reasoning.\n\nFinally final line: only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. All are main IDs (no subtech). So list: T1059, T1071, T1027, T1132, T1505, T1036, T1102.\n\nBut ensure they are in the provided list. T1102 is present. T1505 is present. T1036 present. Good.\n\nNow produce answer with reasoning for each identification. Then final line with IDs.\n\n",

Then final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs.\n\nThe text: \"LIGHTWIRE is a Perl-based web shell used during the Cutting Edge campaign to maintain access and enable command execution by embedding itself into the legitimate `compcheckresult.cgi` component of Ivanti Secure Connect VPNs. LIGHTWIRE communicates with its command and control (C2) server over HTTP and can decrypt RC4-encrypted and Base64-decoded C2 commands. It also encrypts C2 commands using RC4. By embedding into the `compcheckresult.cgi` component, LIGHTWIRE facilitates command execution and establishes persistence on compromised Ivanti Secure Connect VPNs.\"\n\nWe need to identify attack patterns (techniques) described:\n\n- Use of web shell (Perl-based) to maintain access and enable command execution. This is \"Web Shell\" which is a technique: T1100? Not in list. But maybe \"Web Shell\" is part of \"Web Service\" or \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\"? Actually MITRE technique for \"Web Shell\" is T1100? Wait T1100 is \"Web Shell\"? In ATT&CK, T1100 is \"Web Shell\". However not in provided list. The list includes many but not T1100. Could be \"Web Shell\" is under \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) or \"Exploitation for Client Execution\"? Not exactly. But we can map to \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) because it's a script that executes commands. Also \"Web Shell\" is a form of \"Web Service\" (T1102) maybe? Actually T1102 is \"Web Service\". But web shell is a malicious web server component used for C2. Could be \"Web Shell\" falls under \"Web Service\" (C2 over HTTP). Also \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) for C2 over HTTP. The text says communicates over HTTP, encrypts commands using RC4, decrypts RC4-encrypted and Base64-decoded commands. That's \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) for encryption/encoding. Also \"Data Encoding\" (T1132) for Base64. \"Encrypted Channel\" (T1573) for RC4 encryption? Actually RC4 encryption of C2 commands is encryption, but not necessarily a channel encryption; it's data encryption. Could be \"Obfuscated Files or Information\". Also \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" for executing commands via web shell. Persistence by embedding into legitimate component: that's \"Modify Existing Service\"? Actually embedding into legitimate component is \"Masquerading\" (T1036) or \"Component Hijacking\" (T1505? Actually T1505 is \"Server Software Component\". The list includes T1505: Server Software Component. That matches embedding into legitimate component to maintain persistence. So T1505.\n\nAlso \"Persistence\" via \"Web Shell\" could be \"Web Shell\" technique T1100 not listed. But we can map to \"Server Software Component\" (T1505) which is about compromising server software components to maintain persistence.\n\nAlso \"Command Execution\" is \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059). Also \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) for C2 over HTTP.\n\nAlso \"Data Encoding\" (T1132) for Base64. \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) for RC4 encryption.\n\nAlso \"Web Service\" (T1102) maybe for using HTTP for C2.\n\nAlso \"Exfiltration Over Web Service\" not present.\n\nThus list of identified techniques: T1059, T1071, T1027, T1132, T1505, T1036 maybe, T1102.\n\nCheck if T1036 (Masquerading) is appropriate: embedding into legitimate component to hide malicious code. Yes.\n\nNow we need to map each to IDs and provide reasoning.\n\nFinally final line: only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. All are main IDs (no subtech). So list: T1059, T1071, T1027, T1132, T1505, T1036, T1102.\n\nBut ensure they are in the provided list. T1102 is present. T1505 is present. T1036 present. Good.\n\nNow produce answer with reasoning for each identification. Then final line with IDs.\n\n",

The malicious component interprets and runs commands received from the C2 server, which is the core behavior of a command‑and‑script interpreter. |\n| **T1071 – Application Layer Protocol** | The shell “communicates with its command and control (C2) server over HTTP”. Using HTTP (an application‑layer protocol) for C2 traffic matches this technique. |\n| **T1027 – Obfuscated Files or Information** | C2 commands are “RC4‑encrypted and Base64‑decoded”. Encrypting and encoding data to hide its true content is classic obfuscation. |\n| **T1132 – Data Encoding** | The explicit mention of “Base64‑decoded C2 commands” points to the use of data encoding to conceal the payload. |\n| **T1505 – Server Software Component** | LIGHTWIRE “embeds itself into the legitimate `compcheckresult.cgi` component of Ivanti Secure Connect VPNs”. Compromising a legitimate server‑side component to maintain persistence is described by this technique. |\n| **T1036 – Masquerading** | By inserting malicious code into a *legitimate* CGI component, the adversary disguises the malicious functionality as a trusted file, which is the essence of masquerading. |\n| **T1102 – Web Service** | The C2 channel operates over HTTP, a web‑service protocol, to exchange commands and responses. This aligns with the “Web Service” technique for C2 communications. |\n\n**Resulting list of main technique IDs**\n\nT1059, T1071, T1027, T1132, T1505, T1036, T1102"

Managed and sold by the Malteiro cybercriminal group, Mispadu primarily targets victims in Brazil and Mexico, with confirmed operations across Latin America and Europe. Mispadu establishes persistence by creating a link in the startup folder and adding an entry to the registry key `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`. It utilizes malicious Google Chrome extensions to steal financial data and monitors browser activity for online banking actions, often displaying full-screen overlays to block user access to legitimate sites or to prompt for additional data. The trojan can capture and replace Bitcoin wallet addresses in the clipboard on compromised hosts. Mispadu’s dropper uses VBS files to install and execute its payloads. Additionally, the malware steals credentials from mail clients using NirSoft MailPassView and from Google Chrome. Before execution, Mispadu decrypts its encrypted configuration files. Mispadu includes a copy of the OpenSSL library to encrypt its command and control (C2) traffic, and it sends collected financial data to its C2 server.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs**

The list includes many IDs. We need to identify which techniques are described.\n\nText summary:\n\n- Persistence via startup folder and HKCU Run key => technique: \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" (T1547) subtechnique? Actually T1547 is the main technique. Subtechniques include T1547.001 (Registry Run Keys/Startup Folder). Since we need main technique ID only, T1547.\n\n- Malicious Chrome extensions to steal financial data => technique: \"Browser Extensions\" (T1176). Also \"Browser Session Hijacking\" (T1185) maybe? It uses extensions to steal data, monitor browser activity, display overlays. Could be \"Web Service\"? Not. Browser extensions is T1176.\n\n- Monitors browser activity for online banking actions, displays full-screen overlays to block user access or prompt for data => could be \"Input Capture\" (T1056) maybe? Overlays to capture credentials. Could be \"Credential Phishing\"? Not in list. Could be \"Exploitation for Credential Access\"? Not. Might be \"Screen Capture\" (T1113) but overlay is UI manipulation. Could be \"Modify Registry\"? Not. Might be \"User Execution\"? Not. We'll consider \"Input Capture\" (T1056) as capturing credentials via UI.\n\n- Capture and replace Bitcoin wallet addresses in clipboard => technique: \"Clipboard Data\" (T1115). Also \"Modify Registry\"? No.\n\n- Dropper uses VBS files to install and execute payloads => technique: \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) subtechnique VBS. So T1059.\n\n- Steals credentials from mail clients using NirSoft MailPassView and from Google Chrome => technique: \"Credentials from Password Stores\" (T1555). Also \"Credentials from Web Browsers\"? Not in list but T1555 covers password stores.\n\n- Decrypts encrypted configuration files before execution => technique: \"Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\" (T1140) maybe also \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027). Decrypting config is decoding. Use T1140.\n\n- Includes OpenSSL library to encrypt its C2 traffic => technique: \"Encrypted Channel\" (T1573) or \"Obfuscated Files or Information\"? Actually encrypting C2 is \"Encrypted Channel\" (T1573). Also \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) maybe but encryption is T1573.\n\n- Sends collected financial data to C2 server => \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) or \"Exfiltration Over Web Service\" (T1567) if using web. Not specified. We'll pick T1041.\n\n- Also \"Data Staged\" (T1074) maybe before exfil. Not explicit.\n\n- Also \"Data from Local System\" (T1005) for collecting financial data. Could be.\n\n- \"Browser Information Discovery\" (T1217) maybe for monitoring browser activity. Not explicit.\n\n- \"Screen Capture\" maybe for overlay? Not.\n\n- \"Modify Registry\" (T1112) for adding Run key. That's a technique: \"Modify Registry\" (T1112). However persistence via Run key is covered by T1547, but also modifies registry. Should we include both? Usually MITRE maps persistence via Run key to T1547.001. So main technique T1547.\n\n- \"Credential Dumping\"? Not.\n\n- \"Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol\" (T1048) maybe not.\n\n- \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) for C2 using OpenSSL? Could be.\n\n- \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) for encrypted config.\n\n- \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) for VBS.\n\n- \"Browser Extensions\" (T1176).\n\n- \"Clipboard Data\" (T1115).\n\n- \"Credentials from Password Stores\" (T1555).\n\n- \"Encrypted Channel\" (T1573).\n\n- \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041).\n\n- \"Data from Local System\" (T1005) maybe.\n\n- \"Input Capture\" (T1056) for overlays.\n\n- \"Screen Capture\" maybe not.\n\n- \"Browser Session Hijacking\" (T1185) maybe for stealing Chrome data via extension.\n\n- \"Browser Information Discovery\" (T1217) for monitoring activity.\n\nWe need to list all identified techniques with reasoning.\n\nThen final line: IDs for main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs. So list unique main technique IDs: T1547, T1176, T1056, T1115, T1059, T1555, T1140, T1573, T1041, T1005, T1112? Not needed if covered by T1547. But we can include T1112 if we think it's separate. However we should avoid duplication. Provide reasoning for each.\n\nLet's decide final IDs: T1547, T1176, T1056, T1115, T1059, T1555, T1140, T1573, T1041, T1005.\n\nCheck if any other main technique: T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) maybe for C2 using OpenSSL. But encryption is T1573. Could also include T1071. But not necessary.\n\nWe'll include T1071? The text says includes OpenSSL library to encrypt its C2 traffic. That's about encryption, not protocol. So T1573.\n\nThus final line: T1547, T1176, T1056, T1115, T1059, T1555, T1140, T1573, T1041, T1005\n\nNow produce answer with reasoning per technique.",

Provide reasoning for each identification. Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** Mispadu is a banking trojan written in Delphi, first observed in 2019, that operates under a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) model. Managed and sold by the Malteiro cybercriminal group, Mispadu primarily targets victims in Brazil and Mexico, with confirmed operations across Latin America and Europe. Mispadu establishes persistence by creating a link in the startup folder and adding an entry to the registry key `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`. It utilizes malicious Google Chrome extensions to steal financial data and monitors browser activity for online banking actions, often displaying full-screen overlays to block user access to legitimate sites or to prompt for additional data. The trojan can capture and replace Bitcoin wallet addresses in the clipboard on compromised hosts. Mispadu’s dropper uses VBS files to install and execute its payloads. Additionally, the malware steals credentials from mail clients using NirSoft MailPassView and from Google Chrome. Before execution, Mispadu decrypts its encrypted configuration files. Mispadu includes a copy of the OpenSSL library to encrypt its command and control (C2) traffic, and it sends collected financial data to its C2 server.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs**

Managed and sold by the Malteiro cybercriminal group, Mispadu primarily targets victims in Brazil and Mexico, with confirmed operations across Latin America and Europe. Mispadu establishes persistence by creating a link in the startup folder and adding an entry to the registry key `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run`. It utilizes malicious Google Chrome extensions to steal financial data and monitors browser activity for online banking actions, often displaying full-screen overlays to block user access to legitimate sites or to prompt for additional data. The trojan can capture and replace Bitcoin wallet addresses in the clipboard on compromised hosts. Mispadu’s dropper uses VBS files to install and execute its payloads. Additionally, the malware steals credentials from mail clients using NirSoft MailPassView and from Google Chrome. Before execution, Mispadu decrypts its encrypted configuration files. Mispadu includes a copy of the OpenSSL library to encrypt its command and control (C2) traffic, and it sends collected financial data to its C2 server.",
        "98b7e6bc6eb9a1be7504183b3d7dbfee": "We need to extract MITRE Enterprise attack patterns (techniques) from the text, map to IDs, provide reasoning, and final line only IDs for main techniques (excluding subtechnique IDs). The list includes many IDs. We need to identify which techniques are described.\n\nText summary:\n\n- Persistence via startup folder and HKCU Run key => technique: \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" (T1547) subtechnique? Actually T1547 is the main technique. Subtechniques include T1547.001 (Registry Run Keys/Startup Folder). Since we need main technique ID only, T1547.\n\n- Malicious Chrome extensions to steal financial data => technique: \"Browser Extensions\" (T1176). Also \"Browser Session Hijacking\" (T1185) maybe? It uses extensions to steal data, monitor browser activity, display overlays. Could be \"Web Service\"? Not. Browser extensions is T1176.\n\n- Monitors browser activity for online banking actions, displays full-screen overlays to block user access or prompt for data => could be \"Input Capture\" (T1056) maybe? Overlays to capture credentials. Could be \"Credential Phishing\"? Not in list. Could be \"Exploitation for Credential Access\"? Not. Might be \"Screen Capture\" (T1113) but overlay is UI manipulation. Could be \"Modify Registry\"? Not. Might be \"User Execution\"? Not. We'll consider \"Input Capture\" (T1056) as capturing credentials via UI.\n\n- Capture and replace Bitcoin wallet addresses in clipboard => technique: \"Clipboard Data\" (T1115). Also \"Modify Registry\"? No.\n\n- Dropper uses VBS files to install and execute payloads => technique: \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) subtechnique VBS. So T1059.\n\n- Steals credentials from mail clients using NirSoft MailPassView and from Google Chrome => technique: \"Credentials from Password Stores\" (T1555). Also \"Credentials from Web Browsers\"? Not in list but T1555 covers password stores.\n\n- Decrypts encrypted configuration files before execution => technique: \"Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\" (T1140) maybe also \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027). Decrypting config is decoding. Use T1140.\n\n- Includes OpenSSL library to encrypt its C2 traffic => technique: \"Encrypted Channel\" (T1573) or \"Obfuscated Files or Information\"? Actually encrypting C2 is \"Encrypted Channel\" (T1573). Also \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) maybe but encryption is T1573.\n\n- Sends collected financial data to C2 server => \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) or \"Exfiltration Over Web Service\" (T1567) if using web. Not specified. We'll pick T1041.\n\n- Also \"Data Staged\" (T1074) maybe before exfil. Not explicit.\n\n- Also \"Data from Local System\" (T1005) for collecting financial data. Could be.\n\n- \"Browser Information Discovery\" (T1217) maybe for monitoring browser activity. Not explicit.\n\n- \"Screen Capture\" maybe for overlay? Not.\n\n- \"Modify Registry\" (T1112) for adding Run key. That's a technique: \"Modify Registry\" (T1112). However persistence via Run key is covered by T1547, but also modifies registry. Should we include both? Usually MITRE maps persistence via Run key to T1547.001. So main technique T1547.\n\n- \"Credential Dumping\"? Not.\n\n- \"Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol\" (T1048) maybe not.\n\n- \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) for C2 using OpenSSL? Could be.\n\n- \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) for encrypted config.\n\n- \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) for VBS.\n\n- \"Browser Extensions\" (T1176).\n\n- \"Clipboard Data\" (T1115).\n\n- \"Credentials from Password Stores\" (T1555).\n\n- \"Encrypted Channel\" (T1573).\n\n- \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041).\n\n- \"Data from Local System\" (T1005) maybe.\n\n- \"Input Capture\" (T1056) for overlays.\n\n- \"Screen Capture\" maybe not.\n\n- \"Browser Session Hijacking\" (T1185) maybe for stealing Chrome data via extension.\n\n- \"Browser Information Discovery\" (T1217) for monitoring activity.\n\nWe need to list all identified techniques with reasoning.\n\nThen final line: IDs for main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs. So list unique main technique IDs: T1547, T1176, T1056, T1115, T1059, T1555, T1140, T1573, T1041, T1005, T1112? Not needed if covered by T1547. But we can include T1112 if we think it's separate. However we should avoid duplication. Provide reasoning for each.\n\nLet's decide final IDs: T1547, T1176, T1056, T1115, T1059, T1555, T1140, T1573, T1041, T1005.\n\nCheck if any other main technique: T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) maybe for C2 using OpenSSL. But encryption is T1573. Could also include T1071. But not necessary.\n\nWe'll include T1071? The text says includes OpenSSL library to encrypt its C2 traffic. That's about encryption, not protocol. So T1573.\n\nThus final line: T1547, T1176, T1056, T1115, T1059, T1555, T1140, T1573, T1041, T1005\n\nNow produce answer with reasoning per technique.",

Actually \"download files\" is T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer, also T1105 is for transferring tools. Could also be \"Exfiltration Over Web Service\"? No, it's inbound download.

Also \"execute arbitrary commands\" could be \"Command Execution\" which is T1059.\n\n- respond to HTTP POST requests (Web Service? T1102 Web Service). Also \"Web Shell\" is a type of \"Web Service\" or \"Command and Control via Web Service\". T1102 is \"Web Service\". Also \"Application Layer Protocol\" T1071 (C2 over HTTP).

Executing commands on the compromised host is a classic use of the Command‑and‑Scripting Interpreter technique. |\n| **T1105 – Ingress Tool Transfer** | The web shell “has the ability to download files to compromised devices” and is used “for downloading files”. Transferring tools or payloads onto a victim system is mapped to Ingress Tool Transfer. |\n| **T1071 – Application Layer Protocol** | T1071** | WIREFIRE “responds to specific HTTP POST requests” and “sends process output to C2 over HTTP”. Using HTTP as a transport for C2 traffic falls under Application Layer Protocol. |\n| **T1102 – Web Service** | The shell is accessed via a specific API endpoint (`/api/v1/cav/client/visits`) and communicates with the C2 server through HTTP POST requests. This pattern matches the Web Service technique, which describes using legitimate web services/APIs for command‑and‑control. |\n| **T1132 – Data Encoding** | “WIREFIRE can Base64 encode process output sent to C2.” Encoding data before exfiltration is the Data Encoding technique. |\n| **T1140 – Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information** | “WIREFIRE can decode, decrypt, and decompress data received in C2 HTTP POST requests.” Decoding/decrypting received data is captured by the Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information technique. |\n| **T1027 – Obfuscated Files or Information** | “WIREFIRE can AES encrypt process output sent from compromised devices to C2.” Encrypting output to hide its contents is a form of obfuscation, which is covered by Obfuscated Files or Information. |\n| **T1543 – Create or Modify System Process** | The malware “can modify the visits.py component of Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs for file download and arbitrary command execution.” Altering an existing component to run malicious code is an instance of creating or modifying a system process. |\n\n**Final list of technique IDs (main techniques only, no sub‑technique IDs)**  \nT1059, T1105, T1071, T1102, T1132, T1140, T1027, T1543",

Finally, final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs.\n\nThe text describes a web shell (WIREFIRE) that can:\n\n- download files to compromised devices (Ingress Tool Transfer? Actually \"download files\" is T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer, also T1105 is for transferring tools. Could also be \"Exfiltration Over Web Service\"? No, it's inbound download. So T1105.\n\n- execute arbitrary commands (Command and Scripting Interpreter T1059). Also \"execute arbitrary commands\" could be \"Command Execution\" which is T1059.\n\n- respond to HTTP POST requests (Web Service? T1102 Web Service). Also \"Web Shell\" is a type of \"Web Service\" or \"Command and Control via Web Service\". T1102 is \"Web Service\". Also \"Application Layer Protocol\" T1071 (C2 over HTTP). Could be T1071.\n\n- Base64 encode process output sent to C2 (Data Encoding T1132). Also \"Encode\" is T1132.\n\n- decode, decrypt, decompress data received (Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information T1140). Also \"Decrypt\" maybe \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" T1027? Actually T1027 is Obfuscated Files or Information. But decryption is part of that. Could be T1140 Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information.\n\n- AES encrypt process output sent to C2 (Data Encrypted for Impact T1486? Actually encryption for exfil is T1041? No, T1041 is Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. Encryption of data is T1041? Not exactly. There's T1041 for exfil over C2 channel, but encryption is T1486 Data Encrypted for Impact (impact). However encryption for confidentiality is T1041? Actually MITRE has T1041 Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, not encryption. There's T1027 for obfuscation. There's T1486 Data Encrypted for Impact (impact). But here encryption is for C2 communication, not impact. Could be \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" T1027. But we already have encoding and encryption. There's also T1041 for exfil over C2 channel, but not encryption. There's T1071 for Application Layer Protocol. There's T1102 for Web Service. There's T1560 for Archive Collected Data (compress). But decompress is reverse.\n\n- modify the visits.py component for file download? That's \"Modify Existing Service\"? Actually \"Modify component\" is \"Modify Existing System Process\"? T1543? Or \"Modify Registry\"? Not. Could be \"Modify Existing Web Shell\"? Not in list. Could be \"Modify Existing System Process\" T1543. But it's modifying a python script to add malicious functionality. That's \"Modify Existing System Process\" maybe.\n\n- \"web shell written in Python that exists as trojanized logic to the visits.py component\". That's \"Web Shell\" which is a type of \"Web Service\" (C2). Also \"Command and Control\" technique: T1102 Web Service.\n\n- \"download files and command execution\" is T1105 and T1059.\n\n- \"Base64 encode process output\" is T1132 Data Encoding.\n\n- \"decode, decrypt, decompress data received\" is T1140 Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information.\n\n- \"AES encrypt process output\" maybe T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information (encryption). Could also be T1486 Data Encrypted for Impact but that's for impact, not exfil. However MITRE has T1041 Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, but not encryption. There's T1560 Archive Collected Data (compress). Not.\n\n- \"modify the visits.py component\" could be \"Modify Existing System Process\" T1543 (Create or Modify System Process). Or \"Modify Existing Service\" T1543.003? That's subtechnique. But we need main technique ID only, so T1543.\n\n- \"web shell can download files to and execute arbitrary commands\" again T1105, T1059.\n\n- \"respond to specific HTTP POST requests to /api/v1/cav/client/visits\" is \"Web Service\" T1102 or \"Application Layer Protocol\" T1071.\n\n- \"C2 HTTP POST requests\" indicates use of HTTP for C2: T1071.001 (Web Protocols) subtechnique, but main is T1071.\n\nThus main techniques: T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter), T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer), T1071 (Application Layer Protocol), T1132 (Data Encoding), T1140 (Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information), T1543 (Create or Modify System Process) maybe also T1102 (Web Service). But we need to decide which are most relevant.\n\nThe question: \"Extract all MITRE Enterprise attack patterns from the following text and map them to their corresponding MITRE technique IDs. Provide reasoning for each identification. Ensure the final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs.\"\n\nSo we need to list each identified technique with reasoning, then final line with IDs only.\n\nWe should include each technique we think appears. Let's list:\n\n- T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter: because arbitrary command execution.\n\n- T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer: download files to compromised devices.\n\n- T1071 Application Layer Protocol: uses HTTP POST for C2.\n\n- T1102 Web Service: web shell uses HTTP API endpoint.\n\nBut T1102 is \"Web Service\" which is a subcategory of Application Layer Protocol? Actually T1102 is \"Web Service\" (deprecated? In ATT&CK v12, T1102 is \"Web Service\". It's separate. So include.\n\n- T1132 Data Encoding: Base64 encode process output.\n\n- T1140 Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information: decode, decrypt, decompress data.\n\n- T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information: encryption of process output (AES). Could be considered same as T1140? But encryption is obfuscation. Might include T1027.\n\n- T1543 Create or Modify System Process: modify component for command execution.\n\nPotential also T1560 Archive Collected Data (compress) but decompress is mentioned. Not necessarily archiving.\n\nThus main technique IDs: T1059, T1105, T1071, T1102, T1132, T1140, T1027, T1543.\n\nBut we need to exclude subtechnique IDs, which we are not using. All are main.\n\nNow produce answer with reasoning for each, then final line with IDs separated by commas.\n\nLet's craft.",

MITRE Enterprise IDs are given below as reference.  **Text:** LITTLELAMB.WOOLTEA is a backdoor that was used by UNC5325 during Cutting Edge to deploy malware on targeted Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs and to establish persistence across system upgrades and patches. LITTLELAMB.WOOLTEA can append malicious components to the tmp/tmpmnt/bin/samba_upgrade.tar archive inside the factory reset partition in attempt to persist post reset. LITTLELAMB.WOOLTEA can initialize itself as a daemon to run persistently in the background. LITTLELAMB.WOOLTEA can communicate over SSL using the private key from the Ivanti Connect Secure web server. LITTLELAMB.WOOLTEA can monitor for system upgrade events by checking for the presence of /tmp/data/root/dev. LITTLELAMB.WOOLTEA can function as a stand-alone backdoor communicating over the /tmp/clientsDownload.sock socket. LITTLELAMB.WOOLTEA has the ability to function as a SOCKS proxy. LITTLELAMB.WOOLTEA can check the type of Ivanti VPN device it is running on by executing first_run() to identify the first four bytes of the motherboard serial number.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise

Then final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. The list given includes only main technique IDs (no subtechnique). So we need to match text mentions to technique names.\n\nText mentions:\n\n- spreads via automatic replies to incoming WhatsApp messages. That's \"Automatic replies\" maybe \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\"? Not exactly. Could be \"Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol\"? No. It manipulates notifications: \"requests access to the NotificationListenerService, which can allow it to manipulate a device's notifications.\" That's \"Access Notifications\" T1517.\n\n- uses BOOT_COMPLETED action to trigger scripts on boot: that's \"Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts\" T1398.\n\n- automatically send replies to incoming WhatsApp messages: maybe \"Call Control\"? No. Could be \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\"? Not. Might be \"Compromise Application Executable\"? Not. Could be \"Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol\"? Not. Might be \"Input Injection\" T1516 (sending replies). But Input Injection is about injecting input into apps. Automatic replies could be considered Input Injection. However there is also \"Message Manipulation\" not listed. Let's see list: T1626 Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism, T1517 Access Notifications, T1640 Account Access Removal, T1638 Adversary-in-the-Middle, T1437 Application Layer Protocol, T1661 Application Versioning, T1532 Archive Collected Data, T1429 Audio Capture, T1398 Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts, T1616 Call Control, T1414 Clipboard Data, T1623 Command and Scripting Interpreter, T1577 Compromise Application Executable, T1645 Compromise Client Software Binary, T1634 Credentials from Password Store, T1662 Data Destruction, T1471 Data Encrypted for Impact, T1533 Data from Local System, T1641 Data Manipulation, T1407 Download New Code at Runtime, T1456 Drive-By Compromise, T1637 Dynamic Resolution, T1521 Encrypted Channel, T1642 Endpoint Denial of Service, T1624 Event Triggered Execution, T1627 Execution Guardrails, T1639 Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol, T1646 Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, T1658 Exploitation for Client Execution, T1664 Exploitation for Initial Access, T1404 Exploitation for Privilege Escalation, T1428 Exploitation of Remote Services, T1420 File and Directory Discovery, T1541 Foreground Persistence, T1643 Generate Traffic from Victim, T1628 Hide Artifacts, T1625 Hijack Execution Flow, T1617 Hooking, T1629 Impair Defenses, T1630 Indicator Removal on Host, T1544 Ingress Tool Transfer, T1417 Input Capture, T1516 Input Injection, T1430 Location Tracking, T1461 Lockscreen Bypass, T1655 Masquerading, T1575 Native API, T1464 Network Denial of Service, T1423 Network Service Scanning, T1509 Non-Standard Port, T1406 Obfuscated Files or Information, T1644 Out of Band Data, T1660 Phishing, T1424 Process Discovery, T1631 Process Injection, T1636 Protected User Data, T1604 Proxy Through Victim, T1663 Remote Access Software, T1458 Replication Through Removable Media, T1603 Scheduled Task/Job, T1513 Screen Capture, T1582 SMS Control, T1418 Software Discovery, T1635 Steal Application Access Token, T1409 Stored Application Data, T1632 Subvert Trust Controls, T1474 Supply Chain Compromise, T1426 System Information Discovery, T1422 System Network Configuration Discovery, T1421 System Network Connections Discovery, T1512 Video Capture, T1633 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion, T1481 Web Service.\n\nNow map each mention:\n\n- \"requests access to the NotificationListenerService, which can allow it to manipulate a device's notifications.\" => Access Notifications T1517.\n\n- \"may use the BOOT_COMPLETED action to trigger further scripts on boot.\" => Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts T1398.\n\n- \"can hide its application icon.\" => Masquerading? Actually hide icon is a form of Masquerading (T1655). Also could be Hide Artifacts (T1628). But hide icon is about hiding presence, which is Masquerading (disguising). MITRE mobile: Masquerading T1655. Hide Artifacts is about removing evidence. We'll choose Masquerading.\n\n- \"requests overlay permissions, which can allow it to create fake Login screens for other apps.\" => This is a form of Input Injection (creating fake login screens) or Phishing (overlay). MITRE mobile: Phishing T1660? Actually Phishing is about social engineering, but overlay login screens is a UI redressing technique, could be Input Injection (T1516) or Masquerading. However there is also \"Steal Application Access Token\" T1635 but not. I'd map to Input Injection T1516 (injecting UI to capture credentials). Could also be \"Subvert Trust Controls\" T1632 (overlays). But Input Injection seems appropriate.\n\n- \"can steal data from a user’s WhatsApp account(s).\" => This is \"Steal Application Access Token\" T1635 (steal tokens) or \"Credentials from Password Store\" T1634. Since WhatsApp data maybe messages, could be \"Data from Local System\" T1533, but more specific is \"Steal Application Access Token\". We'll map to T1635.\n\n- \"automatically send replies to a user’s incoming WhatsApp messages.\" => Could be \"Call Control\" T1616? That's about controlling calls. Not. Could be \"Input Injection\" again (automated reply). Or \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" T1623 (automated script). But the text says \"FlixOnline primarily spreads via automatic replies to a device’s incoming WhatsApp messages.\" That's a propagation technique using messaging. Might be \"Event Triggered Execution\" T1624 (triggered by incoming message). However the technique is about using messaging to spread. Not in list. Could be \"Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol\" but not. I think best mapping is \"Input Injection\" T1516 (automated reply injection). We'll include.\n\n- \"FlixOnline can hide its application icon.\" already covered.\n\n- \"FlixOnline may use the BOOT_COMPLETED action to trigger further scripts on boot.\" covered.\n\n- \"FlixOnline requests overlay permissions\" covered.\n\n- \"FlixOnline can steal data from a user’s WhatsApp account(s).\" covered.\n\n- \"FlixOnline primarily spreads via automatic replies to a device’s incoming WhatsApp messages.\" maybe also \"Event Triggered Execution\" T1624 (triggered by incoming message). We'll include both? But we need list of all attack patterns identified. Could include both T1624 and T1516. But we must avoid duplicates.\n\n- \"FlixOnline can hide its application icon.\" Masquerading T1655.\n\n- \"FlixOnline requests overlay permissions\" Input Injection T1516.\n\n- \"FlixOnline can hide its application icon.\" also Hide Artifacts T1628? Might be both. But we choose Masquerading.\n\n- \"FlixOnline may use the BOOT_COMPLETED action\" Boot Scripts T1398.\n\n- \"FlixOnline requests access to the NotificationListenerService\" Access Notifications T1517.\n\n- \"FlixOnline can hide its application icon.\" Masquerading T1655.\n\n- \"FlixOnline can steal data from a user’s WhatsApp account(s).\" Steal Application Access Token T1635.\n\n- \"FlixOnline can automatically send replies to a user’s incoming WhatsApp messages.\" Input Injection T1516 (or Event Triggered Execution T1624). Choose Input Injection.\n\nThus identified IDs: T1517, T1398, T1655, T1516, T1635, possibly T1624.\n\nCheck if any other technique: \"requests overlay permissions\" could also be \"Subvert Trust Controls\" T1632 (overlays subvert UI trust). Might be more accurate. But we already have Input Injection.\n\nNow final line should contain only IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs. All are main IDs. Provide reasoning for each.\n\nLet's produce answer with bullet list mapping and reasoning, then final line with IDs: T1517,T1398,T1655,T1516,T1635,T1624 (if we include). But if we decide not to include T1624, final line would be T1517,T1398,T1655,T1516,T1635. Which is better? The text about automatic replies triggered by incoming messages is indeed an event triggered execution (triggered by message). So include T1624.\n\nThus final IDs: T1517,T1398,T1655,T1516,T1635,T1624.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Actually hide icon is a form of Masquerading (T1655). Also could be Hide Artifacts (T1628). But hide icon is about hiding presence, which is Masquerading (disguising). MITRE mobile: Masquerading T1655. Hide Artifacts is about removing evidence. We'll choose Masquerading.\n\n- \"requests overlay permissions, which can allow it to create fake Login screens for other apps.\" => This is a form of Input Injection (creating fake login screens) or Phishing (overlay). MITRE mobile: Phishing T1660? Actually Phishing is about social engineering, but overlay login screens is a UI redressing technique, could be Input Injection (T1516) or Masquerading. However there is also \"Steal Application Access Token\" T1635 but not. I'd map to Input Injection T1516 (injecting UI to capture credentials). Could also be \"Subvert Trust Controls\" T1632 (overlays). But Input Injection seems appropriate.\n\n- \"can steal data from a user’s WhatsApp account(s).\" => This is \"Steal Application Access Token\" T1635 (steal tokens) or \"Credentials from Password Store\" T1634. Since WhatsApp data maybe messages, could be \"Data from Local System\" T1533, but more specific is \"Steal Application Access Token\". We'll map to T1635.\n\n- \"automatically send replies to a user’s incoming WhatsApp messages.\" => Could be \"Call Control\" T1616? That's about controlling calls. Not. Could be \"Input Injection\" again (automated reply). Or \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" T1623 (automated script). But the text says \"FlixOnline primarily spreads via automatic replies to a device’s incoming WhatsApp messages.\" That's a propagation technique using messaging. Might be \"Event Triggered Execution\" T1624 (triggered by incoming message). However the technique is about using messaging to spread. Not in list. Could be \"Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol\" but not. I think best mapping is \"Input Injection\" T1516 (automated reply injection). We'll include.\n\n- \"FlixOnline can hide its application icon.\" already covered.\n\n- \"FlixOnline may use the BOOT_COMPLETED action to trigger further scripts on boot.\" covered.\n\n- \"FlixOnline requests overlay permissions\" covered.\n\n- \"FlixOnline can steal data from a user’s WhatsApp account(s).\" covered.\n\n- \"FlixOnline primarily spreads via automatic replies to a device’s incoming WhatsApp messages.\" maybe also \"Event Triggered Execution\" T1624 (triggered by incoming message). We'll include both? But we need list of all attack patterns identified. Could include both T1624 and T1516. But we must avoid duplicates.\n\n- \"FlixOnline can hide its application icon.\" Masquerading T1655.\n\n- \"FlixOnline requests overlay permissions\" Input Injection T1516.\n\n- \"FlixOnline can hide its application icon.\" also Hide Artifacts T1628? Might be both. But we choose Masquerading.\n\n- \"FlixOnline may use the BOOT_COMPLETED action\" Boot Scripts T1398.\n\n- \"FlixOnline requests access to the NotificationListenerService\" Access Notifications T1517.\n\n- \"FlixOnline can hide its application icon.\" Masquerading T1655.\n\n- \"FlixOnline can steal data from a user’s WhatsApp account(s).\" Steal Application Access Token T1635.\n\n- \"FlixOnline can automatically send replies to a user’s incoming WhatsApp messages.\" Input Injection T1516 (or Event Triggered Execution T1624). Choose Input Injection.\n\nThus identified IDs: T1517, T1398, T1655, T1516, T1635, possibly T1624.\n\nCheck if any other technique: \"requests overlay permissions\" could also be \"Subvert Trust Controls\" T1632 (overlays subvert UI trust). Might be more accurate. But we already have Input Injection.\n\nNow final line should contain only IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs. All are main IDs. Provide reasoning for each.\n\nLet's produce answer with bullet list mapping and reasoning, then final line with IDs: T1517,T1398,T1655,T1516,T1635,T1624 (if we include). But if we decide not to include T1624, final line would be T1517,T1398,T1655,T1516,T1635. Which is better? The text about automatic replies triggered by incoming messages is indeed an event triggered execution (triggered by message). So include T1624.\n\nThus final IDs: T1517,T1398,T1655,T1516,T1635,T1624.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

        "baa2c9061fe16fef41e764f48ec4a0cc": "We need to extract all MITRE Mobile attack patterns from the text and map them to technique IDs. Provide reasoning for each identification. Then final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. The list given includes only main technique IDs (no subtechnique). So we need to match text mentions to technique names.\n\nText mentions:\n\n- spreads via automatic replies to incoming WhatsApp messages. That's \"Automatic replies\" maybe \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\"? Not exactly. Could be \"Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol\"? No. It manipulates notifications: \"requests access to the NotificationListenerService, which can allow it to manipulate a device's notifications.\" That's \"Access Notifications\" T1517.\n\n- uses BOOT_COMPLETED action to trigger scripts on boot: that's \"Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts\" T1398.\n\n- automatically send replies to incoming WhatsApp messages: maybe \"Call Control\"? No. Could be \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\"? Not. Might be \"Compromise Application Executable\"? Not. Could be \"Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol\"? Not. Might be \"Input Injection\" T1516 (sending replies). But Input Injection is about injecting input into apps. Automatic replies could be considered Input Injection. However there is also \"Message Manipulation\" not listed. Let's see list: T1626 Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism, T1517 Access Notifications, T1640 Account Access Removal, T1638 Adversary-in-the-Middle, T1437 Application Layer Protocol, T1661 Application Versioning, T1532 Archive Collected Data, T1429 Audio Capture, T1398 Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts, T1616 Call Control, T1414 Clipboard Data, T1623 Command and Scripting Interpreter, T1577 Compromise Application Executable, T1645 Compromise Client Software Binary, T1634 Credentials from Password Store, T1662 Data Destruction, T1471 Data Encrypted for Impact, T1533 Data from Local System, T1641 Data Manipulation, T1407 Download New Code at Runtime, T1456 Drive-By Compromise, T1637 Dynamic Resolution, T1521 Encrypted Channel, T1642 Endpoint Denial of Service, T1624 Event Triggered Execution, T1627 Execution Guardrails, T1639 Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol, T1646 Exfiltration Over C2 Channel, T1658 Exploitation for Client Execution, T1664 Exploitation for Initial Access, T1404 Exploitation for Privilege Escalation, T1428 Exploitation of Remote Services, T1420 File and Directory Discovery, T1541 Foreground Persistence, T1643 Generate Traffic from Victim, T1628 Hide Artifacts, T1625 Hijack Execution Flow, T1617 Hooking, T1629 Impair Defenses, T1630 Indicator Removal on Host, T1544 Ingress Tool Transfer, T1417 Input Capture, T1516 Input Injection, T1430 Location Tracking, T1461 Lockscreen Bypass, T1655 Masquerading, T1575 Native API, T1464 Network Denial of Service, T1423 Network Service Scanning, T1509 Non-Standard Port, T1406 Obfuscated Files or Information, T1644 Out of Band Data, T1660 Phishing, T1424 Process Discovery, T1631 Process Injection, T1636 Protected User Data, T1604 Proxy Through Victim, T1663 Remote Access Software, T1458 Replication Through Removable Media, T1603 Scheduled Task/Job, T1513 Screen Capture, T1582 SMS Control, T1418 Software Discovery, T1635 Steal Application Access Token, T1409 Stored Application Data, T1632 Subvert Trust Controls, T1474 Supply Chain Compromise, T1426 System Information Discovery, T1422 System Network Configuration Discovery, T1421 System Network Connections Discovery, T1512 Video Capture, T1633 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion, T1481 Web Service.\n\nNow map each mention:\n\n- \"requests access to the NotificationListenerService, which can allow it to manipulate a device's notifications.\" => Access Notifications T1517.\n\n- \"may use the BOOT_COMPLETED action to trigger further scripts on boot.\" => Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts T1398.\n\n- \"can hide its application icon.\" => Masquerading? Actually hide icon is a form of Masquerading (T1655). Also could be Hide Artifacts (T1628). But hide icon is about hiding presence, which is Masquerading (disguising). MITRE mobile: Masquerading T1655. Hide Artifacts is about removing evidence. We'll choose Masquerading.\n\n- \"requests overlay permissions, which can allow it to create fake Login screens for other apps.\" => This is a form of Input Injection (creating fake login screens) or Phishing (overlay). MITRE mobile: Phishing T1660? Actually Phishing is about social engineering, but overlay login screens is a UI redressing technique, could be Input Injection (T1516) or Masquerading. However there is also \"Steal Application Access Token\" T1635 but not. I'd map to Input Injection T1516 (injecting UI to capture credentials). Could also be \"Subvert Trust Controls\" T1632 (overlays). But Input Injection seems appropriate.\n\n- \"can steal data from a user’s WhatsApp account(s).\" => This is \"Steal Application Access Token\" T1635 (steal tokens) or \"Credentials from Password Store\" T1634. Since WhatsApp data maybe messages, could be \"Data from Local System\" T1533, but more specific is \"Steal Application Access Token\". We'll map to T1635.\n\n- \"automatically send replies to a user’s incoming WhatsApp messages.\" => Could be \"Call Control\" T1616? That's about controlling calls. Not. Could be \"Input Injection\" again (automated reply). Or \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" T1623 (automated script). But the text says \"FlixOnline primarily spreads via automatic replies to a device’s incoming WhatsApp messages.\" That's a propagation technique using messaging. Might be \"Event Triggered Execution\" T1624 (triggered by incoming message). However the technique is about using messaging to spread. Not in list. Could be \"Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol\" but not. I think best mapping is \"Input Injection\" T1516 (automated reply injection). We'll include.\n\n- \"FlixOnline can hide its application icon.\" already covered.\n\n- \"FlixOnline may use the BOOT_COMPLETED action to trigger further scripts on boot.\" covered.\n\n- \"FlixOnline requests overlay permissions\" covered.\n\n- \"FlixOnline can steal data from a user’s WhatsApp account(s).\" covered.\n\n- \"FlixOnline primarily spreads via automatic replies to a device’s incoming WhatsApp messages.\" maybe also \"Event Triggered Execution\" T1624 (triggered by incoming message). We'll include both? But we need list of all attack patterns identified. Could include both T1624 and T1516. But we must avoid duplicates.\n\n- \"FlixOnline can hide its application icon.\" Masquerading T1655.\n\n- \"FlixOnline requests overlay permissions\" Input Injection T1516.\n\n- \"FlixOnline can hide its application icon.\" also Hide Artifacts T1628? Might be both. But we choose Masquerading.\n\n- \"FlixOnline may use the BOOT_COMPLETED action\" Boot Scripts T1398.\n\n- \"FlixOnline requests access to the NotificationListenerService\" Access Notifications T1517.\n\n- \"FlixOnline can hide its application icon.\" Masquerading T1655.\n\n- \"FlixOnline can steal data from a user’s WhatsApp account(s).\" Steal Application Access Token T1635.\n\n- \"FlixOnline can automatically send replies to a user’s incoming WhatsApp messages.\" Input Injection T1516 (or Event Triggered Execution T1624). Choose Input Injection.\n\nThus identified IDs: T1517, T1398, T1655, T1516, T1635, possibly T1624.\n\nCheck if any other technique: \"requests overlay permissions\" could also be \"Subvert Trust Controls\" T1632 (overlays subvert UI trust). Might be more accurate. But we already have Input Injection.\n\nNow final line should contain only IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs. All are main IDs. Provide reasoning for each.\n\nLet's produce answer with bullet list mapping and reasoning, then final line with IDs: T1517,T1398,T1655,T1516,T1635,T1624 (if we include). But if we decide not to include T1624, final line would be T1517,T1398,T1655,T1516,T1635. Which is better? The text about automatic replies triggered by incoming messages is indeed an event triggered execution (triggered by message). So include T1624.\n\nThus final IDs: T1517,T1398,T1655,T1516,T1635,T1624.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

The text mentions:\n\n- \"credential stealer\" -> technique: OS Credential Dumping (T1003) maybe also \"Credentials from Password Stores\" (T1555) but specifically \"extract credentials from OS memory\" and \"use PTRACE to attach to a targeted process to read process memory\". That's OS Credential Dumping (T1003). Also \"read /proc/ entries\" to read memory -> OS Credential Dumping (T1003) or \"Process Discovery\" (T1057) for reading /proc entries? Actually reading /proc entries to get process info is Process Discovery (T1057) or \"File and Directory Discovery\" (T1083). But they parse /proc/.../cmdline to look for string -> that's \"Process Discovery\" (T1057) or \"Command Line Interface\"? There's also \"Process Injection\" (T1055) but they attach via ptrace, not injection. So main technique: OS Credential Dumping (T1003). Also \"PTRACE to attach to a targeted process to read process memory\" is also \"OS Credential Dumping\" subtechnique? In ATT&CK, OS Credential Dumping includes subtechniques like \"Proc Filesystem\" (T1003.001). But we only need main technique ID T1003.\n\n- \"use a simple bash script for execution\" -> \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059). Could also be \"Unix Shell\" subtechnique but main is T1059.\n\n- \"written extracted data to tmp/dsserver-check.statementcounters\" -> \"Data Staged\" (T1074) maybe also \"Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol\"? But writing to temp is staging. So T1074.\n\n- \"enter a loop to read /proc/ entries every 2 seconds in order to read a target application's memory.\" That's \"Process Discovery\" (T1057) or \"OS Credential Dumping\". But reading memory of target process is credential dumping. The loop reading /proc entries is also \"Process Discovery\". So include T1057.\n\n- \"parse /proc/.../cmdline to look for string dswsd within the command line.\" That's also \"Process Discovery\" (T1057) or \"Command Line Interface\"? Actually ATT&CK has \"Process Discovery\" (T1057) for enumerating processes. So T1057.\n\n- \"ability to extract credentials from OS memory.\" OS Credential Dumping (T1003).\n\nThus techniques: T1003, T1059, T1074, T1057.\n\nCheck list for IDs: T1059 present, T1074 present, T1057 present, T1003 present.\n\nAny other? \"credential stealer\" maybe \"Credentials from Password Stores\" (T1555) but not mentioned. So stick with these.\n\nNow produce reasoning for each identification.\n\nFinally line: T1003, T1059, T1074, T1057 (order maybe as identified).

              "reasoning": "We need to extract MITRE Enterprise attack patterns (techniques) from the text, map to IDs, provide reasoning, and final line with only IDs for main techniques (no subtechnique IDs). The text describes capabilities: passive backdoor, reverse shell, proxy functionality, uses /bin/sh to create reverse shell and execute commands, AES-128-CBC encrypt data for upload/download, find and append specific files, add itself to exclusion list for integrity checker, download files, communicate with C2 using custom binary protocol, identify running processes and names, create a proxy server, identify specific string in intercepted network traffic to trigger command functionality.\n\nWe need to map each described behavior to MITRE technique IDs.\n\nList of possible techniques:\n\n- Reverse shell / command execution: T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter (using /bin/sh). Also T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer? No that's for transfer. Reverse shell is also T1059 (Command Shell) or T1059.004 (Unix Shell) subtechnique, but we only use main technique ID T1059.\n\n- Proxy functionality: T1090 Proxy.\n\n- Encrypt data for upload/download: T1132 Data Encoding? Or T1486 Data Encrypted for Impact? Actually encryption for C2 is T1573 Encrypted Channel. Also T1132 Data Encoding (maybe). The description: \"use AES-128-CBC to encrypt data for both upload and download.\" That's about encrypting data in transit, which is T1573 Encrypted Channel (encrypted C2). Could also be T1041 Exfiltration Over C2 Channel but encryption is T1573.\n\n- Find and append specific files: maybe T1565 Data Manipulation? Or T1025? Actually \"find and append specific files\" could be T1565 Data Manipulation (modify data). Could also be T1105? Not. Could be T1565.001? But main technique T1565 Data Manipulation.\n\n- Add itself to exclusion list for integrity checker: This is about modifying security tools, maybe T1562 Impair Defenses (Modify or disable security tools). Could be T1562.001 Disable or Modify Tools. So main technique T1562.\n\n- Download files to be saved: T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer (download tools). Also T1074 Data Staged? Not. So T1105.\n\n- Communicate with C2 using custom binary protocol: T1071 Application Layer Protocol (custom protocol). Also T1573 Encrypted Channel if encrypted. But we already have encryption. So T1071.\n\n- Identify running processes and their names: T1057 Process Discovery.\n\n- Create a proxy server on compromised hosts: T1090 Proxy (again).\n\n- Identify specific string in intercepted network traffic to trigger command functionality: This is network sniffing? Intercepted network traffic, looking for string. That's T1040 Network Sniffing (monitor network). Could also be T1046 Network Service Discovery? No. So T1040.\n\n- Passive backdoor: maybe T1547 Boot or Logon Autostart Execution? Not. Passive backdoor is a type of remote access tool. Could be T1219 Remote Access Software. But not explicit.\n\n- Reverse shell: also T1021 Remote Services? Not.\n\n- Use /bin/sh to create reverse shell: T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter.\n\n- Proxy server: T1090 Proxy.\n\n- Exclusion list: T1562 Impair Defenses.\n\n- Encryption: T1573 Encrypted Channel.\n\n- Data manipulation: T1565 Data Manipulation.\n\n- Download files: T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer.\n\n- C2 custom binary protocol: T1071 Application Layer Protocol.\n\n- Process discovery: T1057 Process Discovery.\n\n- Network sniffing: T1040 Network Sniffing.\n\n- Identify string in intercepted network traffic: also T1040.\n\n- Possibly T1082 System Information Discovery? Not mentioned.\n\n- \"find and append specific files on Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs based upon received commands.\" Could be T1565 Data Manipulation (modify files). Could also be T1025? No.\n\n- \"add itself to the exclusion list for the Ivanti Connect Secure Integrity Checker Tool if the --exclude parameter is passed by the tar process.\" That's modifying security tools: T1562 Impair Defenses.\n\n- \"ZIPLINE can download files to be saved on the compromised system.\" That's T1105.\n\n- \"ZIPLINE can communicate with C2 using a custom binary protocol.\" That's T1071.\n\n- \"ZIPLINE can identify running processes and their names.\" That's T1057.\n\n- \"ZIPLINE can create a proxy server on compromised hosts.\" That's T1090.\n\n- \"ZIPLINE can identify a specific string in intercepted network traffic, SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_0.3xx., to trigger its command functionality.\" That's T1040.\n\n- \"ZIPLINE can use /bin/sh to create a reverse shell and execute commands.\" That's T1059.\n\n- \"ZIPLINE can use AES-128-CBC to encrypt data for both upload and download.\" That's T1573 (Encrypted Channel) or T1132 Data Encoding. Likely T1573.\n\nThus list of main technique IDs: T1059, T1090, T1562, T1105, T1071, T1057, T1040, T1573, T1565.\n\nCheck if any other: \"passive backdoor\" maybe T1219 Remote Access Software. Could include but not necessary. The question: \"Extract all MITRE Enterprise attack patterns from the following text and map them to their corresponding MITRE technique IDs.\" So we should include all that apply. Remote Access Software (T1219) is a technique for using remote access tools. The description: \"passive backdoor ... reverse shell and proxy functionality.\" That's remote access software. So include T1219.\n\nAlso \"proxy server\" is T1090.\n\n\"custom binary protocol\" could be T1090? No that's proxy. Application Layer Protocol is T1071.\n\n\"identify running processes\" is T1057.\n\n\"identify specific string in intercepted network traffic\" is T1040.\n\n\"encrypt data\" is T1573.\n\n\"download files\" is T1105.\n\n\"find and append specific files\" is T1565.\n\n\"add itself to exclusion list\" is T1562.\n\n\"reverse shell using /bin/sh\" is T1059.\n\nThus final IDs: T1059, T1090, T1562, T1105, T1071, T1057, T1040, T1573, T1565, T1219.\n\nMake sure no subtechnique IDs (like T1059.004).

ZIPLINE can use /bin/sh to create a reverse shell and execute commands. ZIPLINE can use AES-128-CBC to encrypt data for both upload and download. ZIPLINE can find and append specific files on Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs based upon received commands. ZIPLINE can add itself to the exclusion list for the Ivanti Connect Secure Integrity Checker Tool if the --exclude parameter is passed by the tar process. ZIPLINE can download files to be saved on the compromised system. ZIPLINE can communicate with C2 using a custom binary protocol. ZIPLINE can identify running processes and their names.

        "372c229e2cf5db04cba94973223f9ba6": "We need to extract MITRE Enterprise attack patterns (techniques) from the text, map to IDs, provide reasoning, and final line with only IDs for main techniques (no subtechnique IDs). The text describes capabilities: passive backdoor, reverse shell, proxy functionality, uses /bin/sh to create reverse shell and execute commands, AES-128-CBC encrypt data for upload/download, find and append specific files, add itself to exclusion list for integrity checker, download files, communicate with C2 using custom binary protocol, identify running processes and names, create a proxy server, identify specific string in intercepted network traffic to trigger command functionality.\n\nWe need to map each described behavior to MITRE technique IDs.\n\nList of possible techniques:\n\n- Reverse shell / command execution: T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter (using /bin/sh). Also T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer? No that's for transfer. Reverse shell is also T1059 (Command Shell) or T1059.004 (Unix Shell) subtechnique, but we only use main technique ID T1059.\n\n- Proxy functionality: T1090 Proxy.\n\n- Encrypt data for upload/download: T1132 Data Encoding? Or T1486 Data Encrypted for Impact? Actually encryption for C2 is T1573 Encrypted Channel. Also T1132 Data Encoding (maybe). The description: \"use AES-128-CBC to encrypt data for both upload and download.\" That's about encrypting data in transit, which is T1573 Encrypted Channel (encrypted C2). Could also be T1041 Exfiltration Over C2 Channel but encryption is T1573.\n\n- Find and append specific files: maybe T1565 Data Manipulation? Or T1025? Actually \"find and append specific files\" could be T1565 Data Manipulation (modify data). Could also be T1105? Not. Could be T1565.001? But main technique T1565 Data Manipulation.\n\n- Add itself to exclusion list for integrity checker: This is about modifying security tools, maybe T1562 Impair Defenses (Modify or disable security tools). Could be T1562.001 Disable or Modify Tools. So main technique T1562.\n\n- Download files to be saved: T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer (download tools). Also T1074 Data Staged? Not. So T1105.\n\n- Communicate with C2 using custom binary protocol: T1071 Application Layer Protocol (custom protocol). Also T1573 Encrypted Channel if encrypted. But we already have encryption. So T1071.\n\n- Identify running processes and their names: T1057 Process Discovery.\n\n- Create a proxy server on compromised hosts: T1090 Proxy (again).\n\n- Identify specific string in intercepted network traffic to trigger command functionality: This is network sniffing? Intercepted network traffic, looking for string. That's T1040 Network Sniffing (monitor network). Could also be T1046 Network Service Discovery? No. So T1040.\n\n- Passive backdoor: maybe T1547 Boot or Logon Autostart Execution? Not. Passive backdoor is a type of remote access tool. Could be T1219 Remote Access Software. But not explicit.\n\n- Reverse shell: also T1021 Remote Services? Not.\n\n- Use /bin/sh to create reverse shell: T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter.\n\n- Proxy server: T1090 Proxy.\n\n- Exclusion list: T1562 Impair Defenses.\n\n- Encryption: T1573 Encrypted Channel.\n\n- Data manipulation: T1565 Data Manipulation.\n\n- Download files: T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer.\n\n- C2 custom binary protocol: T1071 Application Layer Protocol.\n\n- Process discovery: T1057 Process Discovery.\n\n- Network sniffing: T1040 Network Sniffing.\n\n- Identify string in intercepted network traffic: also T1040.\n\n- Possibly T1082 System Information Discovery? Not mentioned.\n\n- \"find and append specific files on Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs based upon received commands.\" Could be T1565 Data Manipulation (modify files). Could also be T1025? No.\n\n- \"add itself to the exclusion list for the Ivanti Connect Secure Integrity Checker Tool if the --exclude parameter is passed by the tar process.\" That's modifying security tools: T1562 Impair Defenses.\n\n- \"ZIPLINE can download files to be saved on the compromised system.\" That's T1105.\n\n- \"ZIPLINE can communicate with C2 using a custom binary protocol.\" That's T1071.\n\n- \"ZIPLINE can identify running processes and their names.\" That's T1057.\n\n- \"ZIPLINE can create a proxy server on compromised hosts.\" That's T1090.\n\n- \"ZIPLINE can identify a specific string in intercepted network traffic, SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_0.3xx., to trigger its command functionality.\" That's T1040.\n\n- \"ZIPLINE can use /bin/sh to create a reverse shell and execute commands.\" That's T1059.\n\n- \"ZIPLINE can use AES-128-CBC to encrypt data for both upload and download.\" That's T1573 (Encrypted Channel) or T1132 Data Encoding. Likely T1573.\n\nThus list of main technique IDs: T1059, T1090, T1562, T1105, T1071, T1057, T1040, T1573, T1565.\n\nCheck if any other: \"passive backdoor\" maybe T1219 Remote Access Software. Could include but not necessary. The question: \"Extract all MITRE Enterprise attack patterns from the following text and map them to their corresponding MITRE technique IDs.\" So we should include all that apply. Remote Access Software (T1219) is a technique for using remote access tools. The description: \"passive backdoor ... reverse shell and proxy functionality.\" That's remote access software. So include T1219.\n\nAlso \"proxy server\" is T1090.\n\n\"custom binary protocol\" could be T1090? No that's proxy. Application Layer Protocol is T1071.\n\n\"identify running processes\" is T1057.\n\n\"identify specific string in intercepted network traffic\" is T1040.\n\n\"encrypt data\" is T1573.\n\n\"download files\" is T1105.\n\n\"find and append specific files\" is T1565.\n\n\"add itself to exclusion list\" is T1562.\n\n\"reverse shell using /bin/sh\" is T1059.\n\nThus final IDs: T1059, T1090, T1562, T1105, T1071, T1057, T1040, T1573, T1565, T1219.\n\nMake sure no subtechnique IDs (like T1059.004). Good.\n\nNow produce answer with reasoning for each identification, then final line with IDs separated by commas.\n\n",

Main technique T1543.\n\n- Can encode C2 communications with base64 using custom alphabet. => Data Encoding (T1132). Also Data Obfuscation (T1001) maybe. But base64 is encoding. So T1132.\n\n- Ability to modify headers and URL paths to hide malicious traffic in HTTP requests. => \"Obfuscated Files or Information\"? Not exactly. Could be \"Protocol Tunneling\"? No. \"Masquerading\" T1036? That's for files/services. Modifying headers to hide traffic is \"Network Traffic Manipulation\"? Not in list. Could be \"Web Service\" T1102? But that's using web services. Maybe \"Application Layer Protocol\" again. Or \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) for encoding. But header modification is a form of \"Obfuscation\". We'll include T1027.\n\n- Ability to mimic legitimate services with customized HTTP URL paths and headers to hide malicious traffic. => Masquerading (T1036) (mimic legitimate services). So T1036.\n\n- Loader component can decrypt and decompress the payload. => \"Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\" T1140 (decrypt). Also \"Archive Collected Data\" is not. So T1140.\n\n- Can XOR and AES encrypt C2 messages. => Data Encoding? Actually encryption is \"Data Encrypted for Impact\" T1486? That's for impact. For C2 encryption, technique \"Encrypted Channel\" T1573. Also \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" T1027. But encryption of C2 messages is \"Encrypted Channel\" (T1573). So T1573.\n\n- Store final payload in Registry under HKLM\\... encrypted with key based on drive serial number. => \"Modify Registry\" T1112 (store). Also \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" T1027. Also \"Hide Artifacts\" maybe. We'll include T1112.\n\n- Ability to enumerate directory content. => \"File and Directory Discovery\" T1083.\n\n- Loaders can be side-loaded with legitimate and signed executables including VLC.exe. => \"Masquerading\" again (T1036) or \"Signed Binary Proxy Execution\"? Not in list. Could be \"Hijack Execution Flow\" T1574 (side-loading). But side-loading is a form of \"Hijack Execution Flow\". We'll include T1574.\n\n- Can change or create the last access or write times. => \"Modify Registry\"? No. That's \"Modify timestamps\" which is \"Modify System Image\"? Not. Actually technique \"Modify Existing Files\" not in list. Could be \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" again. There's \"T1070 Indicator Removal\" includes timestomping? Timestomping is part of \"Modify Existing Files\"? Not in list. Could be \"T1070 Indicator Removal\" includes timestomping. So include T1070.\n\nAlso maybe \"Remote Services\" T1021 for remote control. But not explicit.\n\nAlso \"Multiple operators work simultaneously on same machine\" maybe \"Multi-Stage Channels\" T1104? Not.\n\nLet's list identified techniques:\n\n- T1071 Application Layer Protocol\n- T1543 Create or Modify System Process\n- T1132 Data Encoding\n- T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information\n- T1036 Masquerading\n- T1140 Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\n- T1573 Encrypted Channel\n- T1112 Modify Registry\n- T1083 File and Directory Discovery\n- T1574 Hijack Execution Flow\n- T1070 Indicator Removal (timestomping)\n\nCheck if any other: \"Enumerate directory content\" we have. \"Store payload in Registry\" we have.Create services for persistence\" we have. \"Use HTTP for C2\" we have. \"Encode C2 with base64\" we have. \"Modify headers/URL paths\" maybe \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" or \"Masquerading\". Already covered.\n\nNow need to map to IDs and provide reasoning for each.\n\nFinal line: list IDs for main techniques, excluding subtechnique IDs. All are main IDs already (no subtech).

Ninja is possibly part of a post exploitation toolkit exclusively used by ToddyCat and allows multiple operators to work simultaneously on the same machine. Ninja has been used against government and military entities in Europe and Asia and observed in specific infection chains being deployed by Samurai. Ninja can use HTTP for C2 communications. Ninja can create the services httpsvc and w3esvc for persistence. Ninja can encode C2 communications with a base64 algorithm using a custom alphabet. Ninja has the ability to modify headers and URL paths to hide malicious traffic in HTTP requests. Ninja has the ability to mimic legitimate services with customized HTTP URL paths and headers to hide malicious traffic. The Ninja loader component can decrypt and decompress the payload. Ninja can XOR and AES encrypt C2 messages. Ninja can store its final payload in the Registry under $HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\Interface\\ encrypted with a dynamically generated key based on the drive’s serial number. Ninja has the ability to enumerate directory content. Ninja loaders can be side-loaded with legitimate and signed executables including the VLC.exe media player. Ninja can change or create the last access or write times."

              "description": "Ninja is a malware developed in C++ that has been used by ToddyCat to penetrate networks and control remote systems since at least 2020. Ninja is possibly part of a post exploitation toolkit exclusively used by ToddyCat and allows multiple operators to work simultaneously on the same machine. Ninja has been used against government and military entities in Europe and Asia and observed in specific infection chains being deployed by Samurai. Ninja can use HTTP for C2 communications. Ninja can create the services httpsvc and w3esvc for persistence. Ninja can encode C2 communications with a base64 algorithm using a custom alphabet. Ninja has the ability to modify headers and URL paths to hide malicious traffic in HTTP requests. Ninja has the ability to mimic legitimate services with customized HTTP URL paths and headers to hide malicious traffic. The Ninja loader component can decrypt and decompress the payload. Ninja can XOR and AES encrypt C2 messages. Ninja can store its final payload in the Registry under $HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\Interface\\ encrypted with a dynamically generated key based on the drive’s serial number. Ninja has the ability to enumerate directory content. Ninja loaders can be side-loaded with legitimate and signed executables including the VLC.exe media player. Ninja can change or create the last access or write times."

The list includes many IDs. We need to identify which techniques are described.\n\nText summary:\n\n- Ninja malware, C++, used for penetration, remote control.\n- Allows multiple operators to work simultaneously on same machine. (maybe \"Multi-Stage Channels\"? Not exactly. Could be \"Remote Services\"?)\n- Used against gov/military.\n- Deployed by Samurai.\n- Can use HTTP for C2 communications. => Technique: Application Layer Protocol (T1071) (or \"Web Service\" T1102? but HTTP is application layer protocol). Also \"Exfiltration Over Web Service\" T1567? but it's C2 not exfil. So T1071.\n\n- Can create services httpsvc and w3esvc for persistence. => \"Create or Modify System Process\" T1543 (specifically subtechnique T1543.003 Windows Service). Main technique T1543.\n\n- Can encode C2 communications with base64 using custom alphabet. => Data Encoding (T1132). Also Data Obfuscation (T1001) maybe. But base64 is encoding. So T1132.\n\n- Ability to modify headers and URL paths to hide malicious traffic in HTTP requests. => \"Obfuscated Files or Information\"? Not exactly. Could be \"Protocol Tunneling\"? No. \"Masquerading\" T1036? That's for files/services. Modifying headers to hide traffic is \"Network Traffic Manipulation\"? Not in list. Could be \"Web Service\" T1102? But that's using web services. Maybe \"Application Layer Protocol\" again. Or \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) for encoding. But header modification is a form of \"Obfuscation\". We'll include T1027.\n\n- Ability to mimic legitimate services with customized HTTP URL paths and headers to hide malicious traffic. => Masquerading (T1036) (mimic legitimate services). So T1036.\n\n- Loader component can decrypt and decompress the payload. => \"Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\" T1140 (decrypt). Also \"Archive Collected Data\" is not. So T1140.\n\n- Can XOR and AES encrypt C2 messages. => Data Encoding? Actually encryption is \"Data Encrypted for Impact\" T1486? That's for impact. For C2 encryption, technique \"Encrypted Channel\" T1573. Also \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" T1027. But encryption of C2 messages is \"Encrypted Channel\" (T1573). So T1573.\n\n- Store final payload in Registry under HKLM\\... encrypted with key based on drive serial number. => \"Modify Registry\" T1112 (store). Also \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" T1027. Also \"Hide Artifacts\" maybe. We'll include T1112.\n\n- Ability to enumerate directory content. => \"File and Directory Discovery\" T1083.\n\n- Loaders can be side-loaded with legitimate and signed executables including VLC.exe. => \"Masquerading\" again (T1036) or \"Signed Binary Proxy Execution\"? Not in list. Could be \"Hijack Execution Flow\" T1574 (side-loading). But side-loading is a form of \"Hijack Execution Flow\". We'll include T1574.\n\n- Can change or create the last access or write times. => \"Modify Registry\"? No. That's \"Modify timestamps\" which is \"Modify System Image\"? Not. Actually technique \"Modify Existing Files\" not in list. Could be \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" again. There's \"T1070 Indicator Removal\" includes timestomping? Timestomping is part of \"Modify Existing Files\"? Not in list. Could be \"T1070 Indicator Removal\" includes timestomping. So include T1070.\n\nAlso maybe \"Remote Services\" T1021 for remote control. But not explicit.\n\nAlso \"Multiple operators work simultaneously on same machine\" maybe \"Multi-Stage Channels\" T1104? Not.\n\nLet's list identified techniques:\n\n- T1071 Application Layer Protocol\n- T1543 Create or Modify System Process\n- T1132 Data Encoding\n- T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information\n- T1036 Masquerading\n- T1140 Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\n- T1573 Encrypted Channel\n- T1112 Modify Registry\n- T1083 File and Directory Discovery\n- T1574 Hijack Execution Flow\n- T1070 Indicator Removal (timestomping)\n\nCheck if any other: \"Enumerate directory content\" we have. \"Store payload in Registry\" we have.Create services for persistence\" we have. \"Use HTTP for C2\" we have. \"Encode C2 with base64\" we have. \"Modify headers/URL paths\" maybe \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" or \"Masquerading\". Already covered.\n\nNow need to map to IDs and provide reasoning for each.\n\nFinal line: list IDs for main techniques, excluding subtechnique IDs. All are main IDs already (no subtech). So list: T1071, T1543, T1132, T1027, T1036, T1140, T1573, T1112, T1083, T1574, T1070\n\nMake sure order maybe as they appear. Provide reasoning paragraphs.\n\nNow produce answer.",

              "reasoning": "We need to extract MITRE Enterprise attack patterns (techniques) from the text, map to IDs, provide reasoning, and final line only IDs for main techniques (excluding subtechnique IDs). The text describes capabilities: passive backdoor, arbitrary C# code execution, remote admin, lateral movement, .NET HTTPListener to receive HTTP POST, remote command module for execution via Windows command line, create a service at HKLM\\... to trigger execution and maintain persistence, base64 encode data before encryption, exfiltration module to download arbitrary files, encrypt C2 communications with AES, file enumeration, deploy other malware, create directory %COMMONPROGRAMFILES%\\Microsoft Shared\\wmi\\ to contain DLLs for loading successive stages, loader creates multiple Registry keys to force svchost.exe to load final backdoor, ability to call Windows APIs.\n\nWe need to map each described behavior to MITRE technique IDs.\n\nList of possible techniques:\n\n- Arbitrary code execution via C# => Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059) maybe subtechnique .NET? But main technique T1059.\n\n- Remote command module for execution via Windows command line => Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059) again.\n\n- Create a service for persistence => Create or Modify System Process (T1543) subtechnique Service Execution (T1543.003). Main technique T1543.\n\n- Registry keys to force svchost.exe load => Modify Registry (T1112) maybe also Modify Existing Service? But registry keys for svchost: could be \"Modify Registry\" (T1112) or \"Hijack Execution Flow\" (T1574) subtechnique \"DLL Search Order Hijacking\"? Actually forcing svchost to load DLLs via registry keys is \"Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Search Order Hijacking\" (T1574.001). Main technique T1574.\n\n- Base64 encode data before encryption => Data Encoding (T1132). Also encryption of C2 communications => Encrypted Channel (T1573) or \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) but encryption is T1573.\n\n- Exfiltration module to download arbitrary files from compromised machines => Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041) maybe also \"Exfiltration Over Web Service\" (T1567) but generic exfiltration. Could be \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041). Also \"Data from Local System\" (T1005) for file download? Actually exfiltration of files is T1041.\n\n- File enumeration => File and Directory Discovery (T1083).\n\n- Deploy other malware => \"Install Additional Components\"? Could be \"Install Additional Software\" not in list. Maybe \"Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\"? Not. Could be \"Remote Service Session Hijacking\"? Not. Might be \"Supply Chain Compromise\"? Not. Could be \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1105) for transferring malware. But they deploy other malware, maybe \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1105). However the text says \"Samurai has been used to deploy other malware including Ninja.\" That's a capability to install additional malware, which could be \"Install Additional Components\" (T1105). We'll include T1105.\n\n- Create directory %COMMONPROGRAMFILES%\\Microsoft Shared\\wmi\\ to contain DLLs for loading successive stages => \"Modify Registry\"? Not. Could be \"Hide Artifacts\" (T1564) via placing DLLs in known location? Or \"Masquerading\" (T1036) maybe using wmi folder. But not explicit. Could be \"DLL Search Order Hijacking\" again (T1574). We'll keep T1574.\n\n- Ability to call Windows APIs => \"Native API\" (T1106) maybe.\n\n- Passive backdoor remote admin and lateral movement => \"Remote Services\" (T1021) for lateral movement. Also \"Remote Service Session Hijacking\" (T1563) maybe. But remote admin is remote services.\n\n- Use .NET HTTPListener to receive HTTP POST => \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) for C2 over HTTP. Also \"Web Service\" (T1102) maybe. We'll include T1071.\n\n- Use of AES encryption for C2 => Encrypted Channel (T1573).\n\n- Base64 encode data prior to encryption => Data Encoding (T1132).\n\n- Create service for persistence => T1543.\n\n- Registry keys for svchost => T1574.\n\n- File enumeration => T1083.\n\n- System information discovery? Not mentioned but maybe \"System Information Discovery\" (T1082) not explicit.\n\n- Use of Windows command line => T1059.\n\n- Use of Windows APIs => T1106.\n\n- Lateral movement: remote command module for execution via Windows command line could be \"Remote Services\" (T1021) or \"Remote Service Session Hijacking\". We'll include T1021.\n\n- Exfiltration: download arbitrary files from compromised machines is more like \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) or \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1105) for downloading. Actually \"download arbitrary files\" is inbound from C2 to victim? That's \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1105) is for transferring tools to victim. So include T1105.\n\n- Data encoding: T1132.\n\n- Encryption: T1573.\n\n- Create directory for DLLs: maybe \"Masquerading\" (T1036) but not explicit. Could be \"Hide Artifacts\" (T1564). Not sure.\n\n- Use of .NET HTTPListener: \"Web Service\" (T1102) or \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071).

                  "reasoning": "We need to extract MITRE Enterprise attack patterns (techniques) from the text, map to IDs, provide reasoning, and final line only IDs for main techniques (excluding subtechnique IDs). The text describes capabilities: passive backdoor, arbitrary C# code execution, remote admin, lateral movement, .NET HTTPListener to receive HTTP POST, remote command module for execution via Windows command line, create a service at HKLM\\... to trigger execution and maintain persistence, base64 encode data before encryption, exfiltration module to download arbitrary files, encrypt C2 communications with AES, file enumeration, deploy other malware, create directory %COMMONPROGRAMFILES%\\Microsoft Shared\\wmi\\ to contain DLLs for loading successive stages, loader creates multiple Registry keys to force svchost.exe to load final backdoor, ability to call Windows APIs.\n\nWe need to map each described behavior to MITRE technique IDs.\n\nList of possible techniques:\n\n- Arbitrary code execution via C# => Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059) maybe subtechnique .NET? But main technique T1059.\n\n- Remote command module for execution via Windows command line => Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059) again.\n\n- Create a service for persistence => Create or Modify System Process (T1543) subtechnique Service Execution (T1543.003). Main technique T1543.\n\n- Registry keys to force svchost.exe load => Modify Registry (T1112) maybe also Modify Existing Service? But registry keys for svchost: could be \"Modify Registry\" (T1112) or \"Hijack Execution Flow\" (T1574) subtechnique \"DLL Search Order Hijacking\"? Actually forcing svchost to load DLLs via registry keys is \"Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Search Order Hijacking\" (T1574.001). Main technique T1574.\n\n- Base64 encode data before encryption => Data Encoding (T1132). Also encryption of C2 communications => Encrypted Channel (T1573) or \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) but encryption is T1573.\n\n- Exfiltration module to download arbitrary files from compromised machines => Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041) maybe also \"Exfiltration Over Web Service\" (T1567) but generic exfiltration. Could be \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041). Also \"Data from Local System\" (T1005) for file download? Actually exfiltration of files is T1041.\n\n- File enumeration => File and Directory Discovery (T1083).\n\n- Deploy other malware => \"Install Additional Components\"? Could be \"Install Additional Software\" not in list. Maybe \"Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\"? Not. Could be \"Remote Service Session Hijacking\"? Not. Might be \"Supply Chain Compromise\"? Not. Could be \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1105) for transferring malware. But they deploy other malware, maybe \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1105). However the text says \"Samurai has been used to deploy other malware including Ninja.\" That's a capability to install additional malware, which could be \"Install Additional Components\" (T1105). We'll include T1105.\n\n- Create directory %COMMONPROGRAMFILES%\\Microsoft Shared\\wmi\\ to contain DLLs for loading successive stages => \"Modify Registry\"? Not. Could be \"Hide Artifacts\" (T1564) via placing DLLs in known location? Or \"Masquerading\" (T1036) maybe using wmi folder. But not explicit. Could be \"DLL Search Order Hijacking\" again (T1574). We'll keep T1574.\n\n- Ability to call Windows APIs => \"Native API\" (T1106) maybe.\n\n- Passive backdoor remote admin and lateral movement => \"Remote Services\" (T1021) for lateral movement. Also \"Remote Service Session Hijacking\" (T1563) maybe. But remote admin is remote services.\n\n- Use .NET HTTPListener to receive HTTP POST => \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) for C2 over HTTP. Also \"Web Service\" (T1102) maybe. We'll include T1071.\n\n- Use of AES encryption for C2 => Encrypted Channel (T1573).\n\n- Base64 encode data prior to encryption => Data Encoding (T1132).\n\n- Create service for persistence => T1543.\n\n- Registry keys for svchost => T1574.\n\n- File enumeration => T1083.\n\n- System information discovery? Not mentioned but maybe \"System Information Discovery\" (T1082) not explicit.\n\n- Use of Windows command line => T1059.\n\n- Use of Windows APIs => T1106.\n\n- Lateral movement: remote command module for execution via Windows command line could be \"Remote Services\" (T1021) or \"Remote Service Session Hijacking\". We'll include T1021.\n\n- Exfiltration: download arbitrary files from compromised machines is more like \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) or \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1105) for downloading. Actually \"download arbitrary files\" is inbound from C2 to victim? That's \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1105) is for transferring tools to victim. So include T1105.\n\n- Data encoding: T1132.\n\n- Encryption: T1573.\n\n- Create directory for DLLs: maybe \"Masquerading\" (T1036) but not explicit. Could be \"Hide Artifacts\" (T1564). Not sure.\n\n- Use of .NET HTTPListener: \"Web Service\" (T1102) or \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071). We'll include T1071.\n\n- Use of remote command module: \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059).\n\n- Use of Windows APIs: \"Native API\" (T1106).\n\n- Persistence via service: T1543.\n\n- Registry modifications: T1112.\n\n- Hijack Execution Flow: T1574.\n\n- Lateral movement: T1021.\n\n- File and Directory Discovery: T1083.\n\n- Data Encoding: T1132.\n\n- Encrypted Channel: T1573.\n\n- Ingress Tool Transfer: T1105.\n\n- Possibly \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) but we already have T1105 for download. Exfiltration is sending data out; the text says \"exfiltration module to download arbitrary files from compromised machines.\" That's actually exfiltration (sending files out). So T1041.\n\n- Also \"Data Staged\" (T1074) maybe not.\n\n- \"Create Service\" is T1543.\n\n- \"Modify Registry\" is T1112.\n\n- \"Hijack Execution Flow\" is T1574.\n\n- \"Native API\" is T1106.\n\n- \"Application Layer Protocol\" is T1071.\n\n- \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" is T1059.\n\n- \"Remote Services\" is T1021.\n\n- \"File and Directory Discovery\" is T1083.\n\n- \"Data Encoding\" is T1132.\n\n- \"Encrypted Channel\" is T1573.\n\n- \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" is T1105.\n\n- \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" is T1041.\n\n- \"Create or Modify System Process\" is T1543 (already).\n\n- \"Modify Registry\" is T1112.\n\n- Possibly \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" (T1547) not mentioned.\n\n- \"Process Injection\" not mentioned.\n\n- \"DLL Search Order Hijacking\" is subtechnique of T1574, but main technique T1574.\n\nThus list of main technique IDs: T1059, T1543, T1112, T1574, T1071, T1106, T1021, T1083, T1132, T1573, T1105, T1041.\n\nWe need to provide reasoning for each identification.\n\nFinally final line: IDs separated by commas, only main techniques, no subtechnique IDs.\n\nThus final line: T1059, T1543, T1112, T1574, T1071, T1106, T1021, T1083, T1132, T1573, T1105, T1041\n\nCheck if any other technique: \"Create directory %COMMONPROGRAMFILES%\\Microsoft Shared\\wmi\\\" could be \"Masquerading\" (T1036) but not explicit.

Samurai allows arbitrary C# code execution and is used with multiple modules for remote administration and lateral movement. Samurai can use a .NET HTTPListener class to receive and handle HTTP POST requests. Samurai can use a remote command module for execution via the Windows command line. Samurai can create a service at HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\SvcHost to trigger execution and maintain persistence. Samurai can base64 encode data sent in C2 communications prior to its encryption. Samurai can leverage an exfiltration module to download arbitrary files from compromised machines.

But main technique T1059.\n\n- Remote command module for execution via Windows command line => Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059) again.\n\n- Create a service for persistence => Create or Modify System Process (T1543) subtechnique Service Execution (T1543.003). Main technique T1543.\n\n- Registry keys to force svchost.exe load => Modify Registry (T1112) maybe also Modify Existing Service?

Also encryption of C2 communications => Encrypted Channel (T1573) or \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) but encryption is T1573.\n\n- Exfiltration module to download arbitrary files from compromised machines => Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1041) maybe also \"Exfiltration Over Web Service\" (T1567) but generic exfiltration. Could be \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041). Also \"Data from Local System\" (T1005) for file download?

Not. Could be \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1105) for transferring malware. But they deploy other malware, maybe \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1105). However the text says \"Samurai has been used to deploy other malware including Ninja.\" That's a capability to install additional malware, which could be \"Install Additional Components\" (T1105). We'll include T1105.\n\n- Create directory %COMMONPROGRAMFILES%\\Microsoft Shared\\wmi\\ to contain DLLs for loading successive stages => \"Modify Registry\"? Not. Could be \"Hide Artifacts\" (T1564) via placing DLLs in known location? Or \"Masquerading\" (T1036) maybe using wmi folder. But not explicit. Could be \"DLL Search Order Hijacking\" again (T1574). We'll keep T1574.\n\n- Ability to call Windows APIs => \"Native API\" (T1106) maybe.\n\n- Passive backdoor remote admin and lateral movement => \"Remote Services\" (T1021) for lateral movement. Also \"Remote Service Session Hijacking\" (T1563) maybe. But remote admin is remote services.\n\n- Use .NET HTTPListener to receive HTTP POST => \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) for C2 over HTTP. Also \"Web Service\" (T1102) maybe. We'll include T1071.\n\n- Use of AES encryption for C2 => Encrypted Channel (T1573).\n\n- Base64 encode data prior to encryption => Data Encoding (T1132).\n\n- Create service for persistence => T1543.\n\n- Registry keys for svchost => T1574.\n\n- File enumeration => T1083.\n\n- System information discovery? Not mentioned but maybe \"System Information Discovery\" (T1082) not explicit.\n\n- Use of Windows command line => T1059.\n\n- Use of Windows APIs => T1106.\n\n- Lateral movement: remote command module for execution via Windows command line could be \"Remote Services\" (T1021) or \"Remote Service Session Hijacking\". We'll include T1021.\n\n- Exfiltration: download arbitrary files from compromised machines is more like \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) or \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1105) for downloading. Actually \"download arbitrary files\" is inbound from C2 to victim? That's \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" (T1105) is for transferring tools to victim. So include T1105.\n\n- Data encoding: T1132.\n\n- Encryption: T1573.\n\n- Create directory for DLLs: maybe \"Masquerading\" (T1036) but not explicit. Could be \"Hide Artifacts\" (T1564). Not sure.\n\n- Use of .NET HTTPListener: \"Web Service\" (T1102) or \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071). We'll include T1071.\n\n- Use of remote command module: \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059).\n\n- Use of Windows APIs: \"Native API\" (T1106).\n\n- Persistence via service: T1543.\n\n- Registry modifications: T1112.\n\n- Hijack Execution Flow: T1574.\n\n- Lateral movement: T1021.\n\n- File and Directory Discovery: T1083.\n\n- Data Encoding: T1132.\n\n- Encrypted Channel: T1573.\n\n- Ingress Tool Transfer: T1105.\n\n- Possibly \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) but we already have T1105 for download. Exfiltration is sending data out; the text says \"exfiltration module to download arbitrary files from compromised machines.\" That's actually exfiltration (sending files out). So T1041.\n\n- Also \"Data Staged\" (T1074) maybe not.\n\n- \"Create Service\" is T1543.\n\n- \"Modify Registry\" is T1112.\n\n- \"Hijack Execution Flow\" is T1574.\n\n- \"Native API\" is T1106.\n\n- \"Application Layer Protocol\" is T1071.\n\n- \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" is T1059.\n\n- \"Remote Services\" is T1021.\n\n- \"File and Directory Discovery\" is T1083.\n\n- \"Data Encoding\" is T1132.\n\n- \"Encrypted Channel\" is T1573.\n\n- \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" is T1105.\n\n- \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" is T1041.\n\n- \"Create or Modify System Process\" is T1543 (already).\n\n- \"Modify Registry\" is T1112.\n\n- Possibly \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" (T1547) not mentioned.\n\n- \"Process Injection\" not mentioned.\n\n- \"DLL Search Order Hijacking\" is subtechnique of T1574, but main technique T1574.\n\nThus list of main technique IDs: T1059, T1543, T1112, T1574, T1071, T1106, T1021, T1083, T1132, T1573, T1105, T1041.\n\nWe need to provide reasoning for each identification.\n\nFinally final line: IDs separated by commas, only main techniques, no subtechnique IDs.\n\nThus final line: T1059, T1543, T1112, T1574, T1071, T1106, T1021, T1083, T1132, T1573, T1105, T1041\n\nCheck if any other technique: \"Create directory %COMMONPROGRAMFILES%\\Microsoft Shared\\wmi\\\" could be \"Masquerading\" (T1036) but not explicit.

Also T1486 Data Encrypted for Impact (but that's for impact). Probably T1132 Data Encoding (Base64, RC4). Also T1560 Archive Collected Data?

Also T1486 Data Encrypted for Impact (but that's for impact). Probably T1132 Data Encoding (Base64, RC4). Also T1560 Archive Collected Data? Not relevant.\n\n- T1036 Masquerading (web shell embedded in legitimate file querymanifest.cgi). That's masquerading.\n\n- T1564 Hide Artifacts? Not directly.\n\n- T1190 Exploit Public-Facing Application? Not described.\n\n- T1547 Boot or Logon Autostart Execution? Not.\n\n- T1055 Process Injection? Not.\n\n- T1070 Indicator Removal?

Could be T1574 Hijack Execution Flow (modify code to change behavior). But more specific is T1036 Masquerading.\n\n- T1565 Data Manipulation? The web shell encrypts data for C2, that's data encoding.\n\n- T1132 Data Encoding.\n\n- T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information (RC4 encryption, Base64). The technique includes encoding/obfuscation.\n\n- T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter.\n\n- T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer (write malicious payloads to file system).\n\n- T1036 Masquerading (web shell hidden in legitimate file).\n\n- T1565 Data Manipulation?

The list includes many IDs, but we need to identify which techniques are described.\n\nText summary: Akira ransomware written in C++. Executes PowerShell commands to delete system volume shadow copies. Executes from Windows command line, takes arguments. Encrypts victim filesystems. Examines files prior to encryption using GetFileAttributesW. Deletes volume shadow copies via PowerShell. Executes native Windows functions GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo. Can identify remote file shares for encryption. Verifies deletion of volume shadow copies by checking existence of process ID related to process created to delete these items. Uses GetSystemInfo to determine number of processors. Leverages COM objects accessed through WMI during execution to evade detection.\n\nSo techniques:\n\n- Delete system volume shadow copies: This is \"Inhibit System Recovery\" (T1490) or \"Modify System Image\"? Actually deleting shadow copies is a technique to prevent recovery: T1490 Inhibit System Recovery. Also \"Impact: Data Encrypted for Impact\" (T1486) for ransomware encryption. Also \"Data Encrypted for Impact\" is T1486.\n\n- Use PowerShell commands: \"Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell\" is T1059.001 subtechnique, but main technique is T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter. So include T1059.\n\n- Execute from Windows command line: also T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) or \"Command Shell\" subtechnique. So T1059.\n\n- File and Directory Discovery: using GetFileAttributesW to examine files prior to encryption. That's T1083 File and Directory Discovery.\n\n- System Information Discovery: using GetSystemInfo to get number of processors. That's T1082 System Information Discovery.\n\n- Remote File Share Discovery: identify remote file shares for encryption. That's T1135 Network Share Discovery.\n\n- Process Discovery? They verify deletion by checking existence of process ID related to process created to delete items. That's Process Discovery (T1057) maybe.\n\n- Use of COM objects accessed through WMI: WMI usage for execution/evasion. That's \"Windows Management Instrumentation\" T1047. Also \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\"? But WMI is T1047.\n\n- Use of native Windows functions: maybe \"Native API\" T1106.\n\n- Use of PowerShell to delete shadow copies: also \"Modify Registry\"? Not.\n\n- Ransomware encrypts files: Data Encrypted for Impact (T1486). Also \"Data Destruction\" T1485? But encryption is impact.\n\n- \"Delete system volume shadow copies\" also \"Inhibit System Recovery\" T1490.\n\n- \"Delete system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands\" also \"Impair Defenses\"? Not exactly.\n\n- \"Leverage COM objects accessed through WMI during execution to evade detection.\" That's \"Obfuscated Files or Information\"? Not. It's \"Windows Management Instrumentation\" T1047.\n\n- \"Execute from Windows command line and can take various arguments for execution.\" That's \"Command-Line Interface\"? Already T1059.\n\n- \"Identify remote file shares for encryption.\" That's \"Network Share Discovery\" T1135.\n\n- \"Verifies the deletion of volume shadow copies by checking for the existence of the process ID related to the process created to delete these items.\" That's \"Process Discovery\" T1057.\n\n- \"Uses GetSystemInfo to determine number of processors.\" That's \"System Information Discovery\" T1082.\n\n- \"Examines files prior to encryption to determine if they meet requirements for encryption.\" That's \"File and Directory Discovery\" T1083.\n\n- \"Delete system volume shadow copies\" also \"Inhibit System Recovery\" T1490.\n\n- \"Encrypts victim filesystems for financial extortion purposes.\" That's \"Data Encrypted for Impact\" T1486.\n\n- \"Leverages COM objects accessed through WMI during execution to evade detection.\" Could also be \"Obfuscated Files or Information\"? But WMI is T1047.\n\n- \"PowerShell commands\" also \"PowerShell\" subtechnique of T1059, but main T1059.\n\n- \"Native Windows functions\" maybe \"Native API\" T1106.\n\nThus list of main technique IDs: T1059, T1083, T1082, T1135, T1057, T1047, T1106, T1490, T1486.\n\nCheck if any other: \"Delete system volume shadow copies\" also \"Modify System Image\"? Not.\n\n\"Encrypts victim filesystems\" also \"Impact: Data Encrypted for Impact\" T1486.\n\nThus final line: IDs separated by commas, no subtechnique IDs.\n\nNow we need to provide reasoning for each identification.\n\nLet's craft answer: list each technique with description and reasoning.\n\nFinally final line: \"T1059, T1083, T1082, T1135, T1057, T1047, T1106, T1490, T1486\".

Gathering CPU count is a form of System Information Discovery. |\n| **T1135 – Network Share Discovery** | Akira “can identify remote file shares for encryption”. Locating shared network resources is exactly Network Share Discovery. |\n| **T1057 – Process Discovery** | The ransomware “verifies the deletion of volume shadow copies by checking for the existence of the process ID related to the process created to delete these items”. Looking for a specific process ID is a Process Discovery activity. |\n| **T1047 – Windows Management Instrumentation** | It “leverages COM objects accessed through WMI during execution to evade detection”. Use of WMI for execution or discovery maps to the Windows Management Instrumentation technique. |\n| **T1106 – Native API** | The malware “executes native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo”. Direct calls to native Windows APIs are captured by the Native API technique. |\n| **T1490 – Inhibit System Recovery** | Akira “deletes system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands”. Removing shadow copies is a common method to prevent system recovery, which is the Inhibit System Recovery technique. |\n| **T1486 – Data Encrypted for Impact** | The primary payload “encrypts victim filesystems for financial extortion purposes”.

Both PowerShell and the Windows command shell are covered by the Command‑and‑Scripting Interpreter technique. |\n| **T1083 – File and Directory Discovery** | Akira “examines files prior to encryption … through native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW”. Querying file attributes to decide which files to encrypt is a classic File/Directory Discovery behavior. |\n| **T1082 – System Information Discovery** | The malware “uses the GetSystemInfo Windows function to determine the number of processors on a victim machine”. Gathering CPU count is a form of System Information Discovery. |\n| **T1135 – Network Share Discovery** | Akira “can identify remote file shares for encryption”. Locating shared network resources is exactly Network Share Discovery. |\n| **T1057 – Process Discovery** | The ransomware “verifies the deletion of volume shadow copies by checking for the existence of the process ID related to the process created to delete these items”. Looking for a specific process ID is a Process Discovery activity. |\n| **T1047 – Windows Management Instrumentation** | It “leverages COM objects accessed through WMI during execution to evade detection”. Use of WMI for execution or discovery maps to the Windows Management Instrumentation technique. |\n| **T1106 – Native API** | The malware “executes native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo”. Direct calls to native Windows APIs are captured by the Native API technique. |\n| **T1490 – Inhibit System Recovery** | Akira “deletes system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands”. Removing shadow copies is a common method to prevent system recovery, which is the Inhibit System Recovery technique. |\n| **T1486 – Data Encrypted for Impact** | The primary payload “encrypts victim filesystems for financial extortion purposes”.

The list includes many IDs, but we need to identify which techniques are described.\n\nText summary: Akira ransomware written in C++. Executes PowerShell commands to delete system volume shadow copies. Executes from Windows command line, takes arguments. Encrypts victim filesystems. Examines files prior to encryption using GetFileAttributesW. Deletes volume shadow copies via PowerShell. Executes native Windows functions GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo. Can identify remote file shares for encryption. Verifies deletion of volume shadow copies by checking existence of process ID related to process created to delete these items. Uses GetSystemInfo to determine number of processors. Leverages COM objects accessed through WMI during execution to evade detection.\n\nSo techniques:\n\n- Delete system volume shadow copies: This is \"Inhibit System Recovery\" (T1490) or \"Modify System Image\"? Actually deleting shadow copies is a technique to prevent recovery: T1490 Inhibit System Recovery. Also \"Impact: Data Encrypted for Impact\" (T1486) for ransomware encryption. Also \"Data Encrypted for Impact\" is T1486.\n\n- Use PowerShell commands: \"Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell\" is T1059.001 subtechnique, but main technique is T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter. So include T1059.\n\n- Execute from Windows command line: also T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) or \"Command Shell\" subtechnique. So T1059.\n\n- File and Directory Discovery: using GetFileAttributesW to examine files prior to encryption. That's T1083 File and Directory Discovery.\n\n- System Information Discovery: using GetSystemInfo to get number of processors. That's T1082 System Information Discovery.\n\n- Remote File Share Discovery: identify remote file shares for encryption. That's T1135 Network Share Discovery.\n\n- Process Discovery? They verify deletion by checking existence of process ID related to process created to delete items. That's Process Discovery (T1057) maybe.\n\n- Use of COM objects accessed through WMI: WMI usage for execution/evasion. That's \"Windows Management Instrumentation\" T1047. Also \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\"? But WMI is T1047.\n\n- Use of native Windows functions: maybe \"Native API\" T1106.\n\n- Use of PowerShell to delete shadow copies: also \"Modify Registry\"? Not.\n\n- Ransomware encrypts files: Data Encrypted for Impact (T1486). Also \"Data Destruction\" T1485? But encryption is impact.\n\n- \"Delete system volume shadow copies\" also \"Inhibit System Recovery\" T1490.\n\n- \"Delete system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands\" also \"Impair Defenses\"? Not exactly.\n\n- \"Leverage COM objects accessed through WMI during execution to evade detection.\" That's \"Obfuscated Files or Information\"? Not. It's \"Windows Management Instrumentation\" T1047.\n\n- \"Execute from Windows command line and can take various arguments for execution.\" That's \"Command-Line Interface\"? Already T1059.\n\n- \"Identify remote file shares for encryption.\" That's \"Network Share Discovery\" T1135.\n\n- \"Verifies the deletion of volume shadow copies by checking for the existence of the process ID related to the process created to delete these items.\" That's \"Process Discovery\" T1057.\n\n- \"Uses GetSystemInfo to determine number of processors.\" That's \"System Information Discovery\" T1082.\n\n- \"Examines files prior to encryption to determine if they meet requirements for encryption.\" That's \"File and Directory Discovery\" T1083.\n\n- \"Delete system volume shadow copies\" also \"Inhibit System Recovery\" T1490.\n\n- \"Encrypts victim filesystems for financial extortion purposes.\" That's \"Data Encrypted for Impact\" T1486.\n\n- \"Leverages COM objects accessed through WMI during execution to evade detection.\" Could also be \"Obfuscated Files or Information\"? But WMI is T1047.\n\n- \"PowerShell commands\" also \"PowerShell\" subtechnique of T1059, but main T1059.\n\n- \"Native Windows functions\" maybe \"Native API\" T1106.\n\nThus list of main technique IDs: T1059, T1083, T1082, T1135, T1057, T1047, T1106, T1490, T1486.\n\nCheck if any other: \"Delete system volume shadow copies\" also \"Modify System Image\"? Not.\n\n\"Encrypts victim filesystems\" also \"Impact: Data Encrypted for Impact\" T1486.\n\nThus final line: IDs separated by commas, no subtechnique IDs.\n\nNow we need to provide reasoning for each identification.\n\nLet's craft answer: list each technique with description and reasoning.\n\nFinally final line: \"T1059, T1083, T1082, T1135, T1057, T1047, T1106, T1490, T1486\".

        "2fbe725ffb2942e2dbab73caeac19c3a": "**Identified MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise techniques**\n\n| Technique (ID) | Reason the text maps to this technique |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter** | The ransomware “executes PowerShell commands” and “executes from the Windows command line”. Both PowerShell and the Windows command shell are covered by the Command‑and‑Scripting Interpreter technique. |\n| **T1083 – File and Directory Discovery** | Akira “examines files prior to encryption … through native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW”. Querying file attributes to decide which files to encrypt is a classic File/Directory Discovery behavior. |\n| **T1082 – System Information Discovery** | The malware “uses the GetSystemInfo Windows function to determine the number of processors on a victim machine”. Gathering CPU count is a form of System Information Discovery. |\n| **T1135 – Network Share Discovery** | Akira “can identify remote file shares for encryption”. Locating shared network resources is exactly Network Share Discovery. |\n| **T1057 – Process Discovery** | The ransomware “verifies the deletion of volume shadow copies by checking for the existence of the process ID related to the process created to delete these items”. Looking for a specific process ID is a Process Discovery activity. |\n| **T1047 – Windows Management Instrumentation** | It “leverages COM objects accessed through WMI during execution to evade detection”. Use of WMI for execution or discovery maps to the Windows Management Instrumentation technique. |\n| **T1106 – Native API** | The malware “executes native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo”. Direct calls to native Windows APIs are captured by the Native API technique. |\n| **T1490 – Inhibit System Recovery** | Akira “deletes system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands”. Removing shadow copies is a common method to prevent system recovery, which is the Inhibit System Recovery technique. |\n| **T1486 – Data Encrypted for Impact** | The primary payload “encrypts victim filesystems for financial extortion purposes”. Encrypting data to cause impact is the Data Encrypted for Impact technique. |\n\n**Final list of main technique IDs (comma‑separated, no sub‑technique IDs)**  \nT1059, T1083, T1082, T1135, T1057, T1047, T1106, T1490, T1486"

The list includes many IDs. We need to identify which techniques are described in the text.\n\nLet's parse the text:\n\n\"NKAbuse is a Go-based, multi-platform malware abusing NKN (New Kind of Network) technology for data exchange between peers, functioning as a potent implant, and equipped with both flooder and backdoor capabilities. NKAbuse is initially installed and executed through an initial shell script. NKAbuse enables multiple types of network denial of service capabilities across several protocols post-installation. NKAbuse will check victim systems to ensure only one copy of the malware is running. NKAbuse has abused the NKN public blockchain protocol for its C2 communications. NKAbuse uses a Cron job to establish persistence when infecting Linux hosts. NKAbuse can take screenshots of the victim machine. NKAbuse conducts multiple system checks and includes these in subsequent \"heartbeat\" messages to the malware's command and control server. NKAbuse utilizes external services such as ifconfig.me to identify the victim machine's IP address.\"\n\nIdentify techniques:\n\n- \"initially installed and executed through an initial shell script.\" => Execution via Command and Scripting Interpreter? Shell script is a script interpreter. Could be T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter). Also could be T1037 (Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts) but that's for persistence. However initial execution via script is just execution. So T1059.\n\n- \"multiple types of network denial of service capabilities across several protocols post-installation.\" => Network Denial of Service. That's T1499 (Endpoint Denial of Service) or T1498 (Network Denial of Service). The text says network denial of service across protocols. So T1498 (Network Denial of Service). Also T1499 is endpoint DoS. We'll choose T1498.\n\n- \"check victim systems to ensure only one copy of the malware is running.\" That's a form of \"Process Discovery\" (checking processes) or \"Check for duplicate instances\". Could be T1057 (Process Discovery) or T1546? Not exactly. It's a guard to ensure only one copy. Could be \"Execution Guardrails\" (T1480) which is about ensuring conditions before execution. But the description is about checking for other copies. Might be \"Process Discovery\". We'll include T1057.\n\n- \"abused the NKN public blockchain protocol for its C2 communications.\" That's using \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) or \"Web Service\" (T1102) or \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\"? Actually using blockchain as C2 is a \"Web Service\" or \"Application Layer Protocol\". T1071 is Application Layer Protocol. Also T1041 is Exfiltration Over C2 Channel but not about C2. So T1071.\n\n- \"uses a Cron job to establish persistence when infecting Linux hosts.\" That's \"Scheduled Task/Job\" (T1053) or \"Cron\" is a scheduled job. So T1053 (Scheduled Task/Job). Also could be \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" but Cron is scheduled. So T1053.\n\n- \"can take screenshots of the victim machine.\" That's Screen Capture (T1113).\n\n- \"conducts multiple system checks and includes these in subsequent heartbeat messages\" => System Information Discovery (T1082) or \"Gather Victim Host Information\" (T1592). The list includes T1592: Gather Victim Host Information. Also T1082 is System Information Discovery. We'll map to T1082 (System Information Discovery) and maybe T1592.\n\n- \"utilizes external services such as ifconfig.me to identify the victim machine's IP address.\" That's \"Network Service Discovery\"? Actually using external service to get public IP is \"External Remote Services\"? Not exactly. Could be \"Network Service Discovery\" (T1046) but that's scanning local network. Using external service to get IP is \"Obtain External IP Address\" which is part of \"Network Service Discovery\"? MITRE has technique \"Network Service Scanning\"? Not. There's T1016: System Network Configuration Discovery (includes IP address). Also T1590: Gather Victim Network Information. So T1016 or T1590. We'll choose T1016 (System Network Configuration Discovery) or T1590. Since they ask for main technique IDs, we can include both.\n\n- Also \"backdoor capabilities\" maybe \"Remote Access Software\" (T1219) but not explicit.\n\n- \"initially installed and executed through an initial shell script.\" Could also be \"Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts\" (T1037) for persistence but they said initial install, not persistence. We'll keep T1059.\n\n- \"multi-platform malware\" maybe \"Cross-Platform\" not a technique.\n\n- \"flooder\" is DoS.\n\n- \"C2 communications via blockchain\" could be \"Web Service\" (T1102) as blockchain is a web service. But T1071 is generic.\n\n- \"Cron job\" is scheduled task.\n\n- \"Screen capture\" T1113.\n\n- \"System checks\" T1082.\n\n- \"External services to identify IP\" T1016.\n\n- \"Check only one copy running\" maybe \"Process Discovery\" T1057.\n\nNow compile list of unique technique IDs:\n\nT1059 (Command and S",

We need to identify which techniques are described in the text.\n\nLet's parse the text:\n\n\"NKAbuse is a Go-based, multi-platform malware abusing NKN (New Kind of Network) technology for data exchange between peers, functioning as a potent implant, and equipped with both flooder and backdoor capabilities. NKAbuse is initially installed and executed through an initial shell script. NKAbuse enables multiple types of network denial of service capabilities across several protocols post-installation. NKAbuse will check victim systems to ensure only one copy of the malware is running. NKAbuse has abused the NKN public blockchain protocol for its C2 communications. NKAbuse uses a Cron job to establish persistence when infecting Linux hosts. NKAbuse can take screenshots of the victim machine. NKAbuse conducts multiple system checks and includes these in subsequent \"heartbeat\" messages to the malware's command and control server. NKAbuse utilizes external services such as ifconfig.me to identify the victim machine's IP address.\"\n\nIdentify techniques:\n\n- \"initially installed and executed through an initial shell script.\" => Execution via Command and Scripting Interpreter? Shell script is a script interpreter. Could be T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter). Also could be T1037 (Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts) but that's for persistence. However initial execution via script is just execution. So T1059.\n\n- \"multiple types of network denial of service capabilities across several protocols post-installation.\" => Network Denial of Service. That's T1499 (Endpoint Denial of Service) or T1498 (Network Denial of Service). The text says network denial of service across protocols. So T1498 (Network Denial of Service). Also T1499 is endpoint DoS. We'll choose T1498.\n\n- \"check victim systems to ensure only one copy of the malware is running.\" That's a form of \"Process Discovery\" (checking processes) or \"Check for duplicate instances\". Could be T1057 (Process Discovery) or T1546? Not exactly. It's a guard to ensure only one copy. Could be \"Execution Guardrails\" (T1480) which is about ensuring conditions before execution. But the description is about checking for other copies. Might be \"Process Discovery\". We'll include T1057.\n\n- \"abused the NKN public blockchain protocol for its C2 communications.\" That's using \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) or \"Web Service\" (T1102) or \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\"? Actually using blockchain as C2 is a \"Web Service\" or \"Application Layer Protocol\". T1071 is Application Layer Protocol. Also T1041 is Exfiltration Over C2 Channel but not about C2. So T1071.\n\n- \"uses a Cron job to establish persistence when infecting Linux hosts.\" That's \"Scheduled Task/Job\" (T1053) or \"Cron\" is a scheduled job. So T1053 (Scheduled Task/Job). Also could be \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" but Cron is scheduled. So T1053.\n\n- \"can take screenshots of the victim machine.\" That's Screen Capture (T1113).\n\n- \"conducts multiple system checks and includes these in subsequent heartbeat messages\" => System Information Discovery (T1082) or \"Gather Victim Host Information\" (T1592). The list includes T1592: Gather Victim Host Information. Also T1082 is System Information Discovery. We'll map to T1082 (System Information Discovery) and maybe T1592.\n\n- \"utilizes external services such as ifconfig.me to identify the victim machine's IP address.\" That's \"Network Service Discovery\"? Actually using external service to get public IP is \"External Remote Services\"? Not exactly. Could be \"Network Service Discovery\" (T1046) but that's scanning local network. Using external service to get IP is \"Obtain External IP Address\" which is part of \"Network Service Discovery\"? MITRE has technique \"Network Service Scanning\"? Not. There's T1016: System Network Configuration Discovery (includes IP address). Also T1590: Gather Victim Network Information. So T1016 or T1590. We'll choose T1016 (System Network Configuration Discovery) or T1590. Since they ask for main technique IDs, we can include both.\n\n- Also \"backdoor capabilities\" maybe \"Remote Access Software\" (T1219) but not explicit.\n\n- \"initially installed and executed through an initial shell script.\" Could also be \"Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts\" (T1037) for persistence but they said initial install, not persistence. We'll keep T1059.\n\n- \"multi-platform malware\" maybe \"Cross-Platform\" not a technique.\n\n- \"flooder\" is DoS.\n\n- \"C2 communications via blockchain\" could be \"Web Service\" (T1102) as blockchain is a web service. But T1071 is generic.\n\n- \"Cron job\" is scheduled task.\n\n- \"Screen capture\" T1113.\n\n- \"System checks\" T1082.\n\n- \"External services to identify IP\" T1016.\n\n- \"Check only one copy running\" maybe \"Process Discovery\" T1057.\n\nNow compile list of unique technique IDs:\n\nT1059 (Command and S",

NKAbuse utilizes external services such as ifconfig.me to identify the victim machine's IP address.\"\n\nIdentify techniques:\n\n- \"initially installed and executed through an initial shell script.\" => Execution via Command and Scripting Interpreter? Shell script is a script interpreter. Could be T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter). Also could be T1037 (Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts) but that's for persistence. However initial execution via script is just execution. So T1059.\n\n- \"multiple types of network denial of service capabilities across several protocols post-installation.\" => Network Denial of Service. That's T1499 (Endpoint Denial of Service) or T1498 (Network Denial of Service). The text says network denial of service across protocols. So T1498 (Network Denial of Service). Also T1499 is endpoint DoS. We'll choose T1498.\n\n- \"check victim systems to ensure only one copy of the malware is running.\" That's a form of \"Process Discovery\" (checking processes) or \"Check for duplicate instances\". Could be T1057 (Process Discovery) or T1546? Not exactly. It's a guard to ensure only one copy. Could be \"Execution Guardrails\" (T1480) which is about ensuring conditions before execution. But the description is about checking for other copies. Might be \"Process Discovery\". We'll include T1057.\n\n- \"abused the NKN public blockchain protocol for its C2 communications.\" That's using \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) or \"Web Service\" (T1102) or \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\"? Actually using blockchain as C2 is a \"Web Service\" or \"Application Layer Protocol\". T1071 is Application Layer Protocol. Also T1041 is Exfiltration Over C2 Channel but not about C2. So T1071.\n\n- \"uses a Cron job to establish persistence when infecting Linux hosts.\" That's \"Scheduled Task/Job\" (T1053) or \"Cron\" is a scheduled job. So T1053 (Scheduled Task/Job). Also could be \"Boot or Logon Autostart Execution\" but Cron is scheduled. So T1053.\n\n- \"can take screenshots of the victim machine.\" That's Screen Capture (T1113).\n\n- \"conducts multiple system checks and includes these in subsequent heartbeat messages\" => System Information Discovery (T1082) or \"Gather Victim Host Information\" (T1592). The list includes T1592: Gather Victim Host Information. Also T1082 is System Information Discovery. We'll map to T1082 (System Information Discovery) and maybe T1592.\n\n- \"utilizes external services such as ifconfig.me to identify the victim machine's IP address.\" That's \"Network Service Discovery\"? Actually using external service to get public IP is \"External Remote Services\"? Not exactly. Could be \"Network Service Discovery\" (T1046) but that's scanning local network. Using external service to get IP is \"Obtain External IP Address\" which is part of \"Network Service Discovery\"? MITRE has technique \"Network Service Scanning\"? Not. There's T1016: System Network Configuration Discovery (includes IP address). Also T1590: Gather Victim Network Information. So T1016 or T1590. We'll choose T1016 (System Network Configuration Discovery) or T1590. Since they ask for main technique IDs, we can include both.\n\n- Also \"backdoor capabilities\" maybe \"Remote Access Software\" (T1219) but not explicit.\n\n- \"initially installed and executed through an initial shell script.\" Could also be \"Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts\" (T1037) for persistence but they said initial install, not persistence. We'll keep T1059.\n\n- \"multi-platform malware\" maybe \"Cross-Platform\" not a technique.\n\n- \"flooder\" is DoS.\n\n- \"C2 communications via blockchain\" could be \"Web Service\" (T1102) as blockchain is a web service. But T1071 is generic.\n\n- \"Cron job\" is scheduled task.\n\n- \"Screen capture\" T1113.\n\n- \"System checks\" T1082.\n\n- \"External services to identify IP\" T1016.\n\n- \"Check only one copy running\" maybe \"Process Discovery\" T1057.\n\nNow compile list of unique technique IDs:\n\nT1059 (Command and S"

SLOWPULSE has several variants and can modify legitimate Pulse Secure VPN files in order to log credentials and bypass single and two-factor authentication flows. SLOWPULSE is applied in compromised environments through modifications to legitimate Pulse Secure files. SLOWPULSE can write logged ACE credentials to /home/perl/PAUS.pm in append mode, using the format string %s:%s\\n. SLOWPULSE can modify LDAP and two factor authentication flows by inspecting login credentials and forcing successful authentication if the provided password matches a chosen backdoor password. SLOWPULSE can insert malicious logic to bypass RADIUS and ACE two factor authentication (2FA) flows if a designated attacker-supplied password is provided. SLOWPULSE can log credentials on compromised Pulse Secure VPNs during the DSAuth::AceAuthServer::checkUsernamePasswordACE-2FA authentication procedure. SLOWPULSE can hide malicious code in the padding regions between legitimate functions in the Pulse Secure libdsplibs.so file.  **List of All MITRE Enterprise technique IDs** ID    : Name T1548 : Abuse

Actually \"Modify Authentication Process\" (T1556) is about modifying authentication. Also \"Credentials In Files\" maybe? There's \"Credentials from Password Stores\" (T1555) but here they log credentials to a file. That's \"Exfiltration Over ...\"? Not. \"Credential Dumping\"? Not exactly. \"Input Capture\" (T1056) maybe? Logging credentials via code injection. Could be \"Credentials In Files\" is T1552? Actually T1552 is \"Unsecured Credentials\". But storing credentials in a file is \"Credentials In Files\" (T1552.001). However subtechnique. We need main technique ID only, so T1552.\n\n- Bypass authentication: \"Modify Authentication Process\" T1556.\n\n- \"Exfiltration Over ...\"?

Could be \"Obfuscated Files or Information\". Also \"Masquerading\" (T1036) maybe because modifying legitimate files.\n\n- \"Write logged credentials to file\": \"Exfiltration Over ...\"? Not. Could be \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\"? Not.\n\n- \"Modify LDAP and two factor authentication flows\": again \"Modify Authentication Process\" (T1556). Also \"Credential Access\" maybe \"Credentials from Password Stores\" (T1555) but they are capturing credentials.\n\n- \"Insert malicious logic to bypass RADIUS and ACE 2FA flows\": again \"Modify Authentication Process\".\n\n- \"Log credentials on compromised Pulse Secure VPNs during authentication procedure\": \"Credential Dumping\"? Not. \"Input Capture\" (T1056) maybe \"Keylogging\"? But they capture credentials via code injection, not keylogging. Could be \"Credentials In Files\" (T1552) or \"Credentials from Password Stores\" (T1555).

Also \"Masquerading\" (T1036) because they hide in legitimate library.\n\n- \"Modify legitimate Pulse Secure files\": \"Modify Existing Service\"? Actually \"Modify Existing Service\" is T1543.003 (subtech). Main technique is \"Create or Modify System Process\" (T1543). But they modify a library file, not a service. Could be \"Modify Existing Service\" but that's subtech. Main technique \"Modify Existing Service\" is subtech of T1543. So main technique T1543.\n\n- \"Compromise Accounts\"? They use backdoor password to bypass authentication, maybe \"Valid Accounts\" (T1078). But they are creating a backdoor password, not using stolen credentials. Could be \"Valid Accounts\" as they allow attacker-supplied password to succeed.\n\n- \"Credential Access\" maybe \"Credentials In Files\" (T1552) and \"Input Capture\" (T1056). Also \"Exfiltration Over ...\"? Not.\n\n- \"Hide Artifacts\" (T1564) is about hiding malicious code.\n\n- \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) also.\n\n- \"Modify Authentication Process\" (T1556) is definitely.\n\n- \"Valid Accounts\" (T1078) maybe.\n\n- \"Masquerading\" (T1036) because they modify legitimate files.\n\n- \"Exfiltration Over ...\"?

Also \"Masquerading\" (T1036) because they hide in legitimate library.\n\n- \"Modify legitimate Pulse Secure files\": \"Modify Existing Service\"? Actually \"Modify Existing Service\" is T1543.003 (subtech). Main technique is \"Create or Modify System Process\" (T1543). But they modify a library file, not a service. Could be \"Modify Existing Service\" but that's subtech. Main technique \"Modify Existing Service\" is subtech of T1543. So main technique T1543.\n\n- \"Compromise Accounts\"? They use backdoor password to bypass authentication, maybe \"Valid Accounts\" (T1078). But they are creating a backdoor password, not using stolen credentials. Could be \"Valid Accounts\" as they allow attacker-supplied password to succeed.\n\n- \"Credential Access\" maybe \"Credentials In Files\" (T1552) and \"Input Capture\" (T1056). Also \"Exfiltration Over ...\"? Not.\n\n- \"Hide Artifacts\" (T1564) is about hiding malicious code.\n\n- \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) also.\n\n- \"Modify Authentication Process\" (T1556) is definitely.\n\n- \"Valid Accounts\" (T1078) maybe.\n\n- \"Masquerading\" (T1036) because they modify legitimate files.\n\n- \"Exfiltration Over ...\"? Not.\n\n- \"Credential Dumping\" (T1003) not.\n\n- \"Credential Access\" \"Credentials from Password Stores\" (T1555) not.\n\n- \"Credential Access\" \"Credentials In Files\" (T1552) yes.\n\n- \"Modify Existing Service\" (subtech) but main T1543.\n\n- \"Hide Artifacts\" (T1564) maybe.\n\n- \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) maybe.\n\n- \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" not.\n\n- \"Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol\" not.\n\n- \"Data Staged\" not.\n\n- \"Exfiltration Over Web Service\" not.\n\n- \"Network Service Discovery\" not.\n\n- \"System Binary Proxy Execution\" not.\n\n- \"Process Injection\" not.\n\n- \"Reflective Code Loading\" not.\n\n- \"Hijack Execution Flow\" (T1574) maybe because they insert malicious logic into library functions. Could be.\n\n- \"Modify Authentication Process\" is main.\n\n- \"Valid Accounts\" maybe.\n\n- \"Credentials In Files\" (T1552) is main.\n\n- \"Hide Artifacts\" (T1564) is main.\n\n- \"Masquerading\" (T1036) is main",

The text describes SLOWPULSE malware that modifies legitimate Pulse Secure VPN files to log credentials, bypass authentication, hide malicious code in padding, write logged credentials to a file, modify LDAP and 2FA flows, insert malicious logic to bypass RADIUS and ACE 2FA, log credentials during authentication procedure, hide code in padding regions of a library.\n\nWe need to identify relevant MITRE techniques:\n\n- Modify legitimate files to insert malicious code: \"Modify Existing Service\" maybe? Actually \"Modify Authentication Process\" (T1556) is about modifying authentication. Also \"Credentials In Files\" maybe? There's \"Credentials from Password Stores\" (T1555) but here they log credentials to a file. That's \"Exfiltration Over ...\"? Not. \"Credential Dumping\"? Not exactly. \"Input Capture\" (T1056) maybe? Logging credentials via code injection. Could be \"Credentials In Files\" is T1552? Actually T1552 is \"Unsecured Credentials\". But storing credentials in a file is \"Credentials In Files\" (T1552.001). However subtechnique. We need main technique ID only, so T1552.\n\n- Bypass authentication: \"Modify Authentication Process\" T1556.\n\n- \"Exfiltration Over ...\"? Not described.\n\n- \"Hide malicious code in padding regions\": \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) or \"Hide Artifacts\" (T1564). Padding region is a form of \"Hide Artifacts\". Could be \"Obfuscated Files or Information\". Also \"Masquerading\" (T1036) maybe because modifying legitimate files.\n\n- \"Write logged credentials to file\": \"Exfiltration Over ...\"? Not. Could be \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\"? Not.\n\n- \"Modify LDAP and two factor authentication flows\": again \"Modify Authentication Process\" (T1556). Also \"Credential Access\" maybe \"Credentials from Password Stores\" (T1555) but they are capturing credentials.\n\n- \"Insert malicious logic to bypass RADIUS and ACE 2FA flows\": again \"Modify Authentication Process\".\n\n- \"Log credentials on compromised Pulse Secure VPNs during authentication procedure\": \"Credential Dumping\"? Not. \"Input Capture\" (T1056) maybe \"Keylogging\"? But they capture credentials via code injection, not keylogging. Could be \"Credentials In Files\" (T1552) or \"Credentials from Password Stores\" (T1555). However they are capturing credentials from authentication process, which is \"Credentials In Files\" after they write them.\n\n- \"Hide malicious code in padding regions between legitimate functions\": \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) or \"Hide Artifacts\" (T1564). Also \"Masquerading\" (T1036) because they hide in legitimate library.\n\n- \"Modify legitimate Pulse Secure files\": \"Modify Existing Service\"? Actually \"Modify Existing Service\" is T1543.003 (subtech). Main technique is \"Create or Modify System Process\" (T1543). But they modify a library file, not a service. Could be \"Modify Existing Service\" but that's subtech. Main technique \"Modify Existing Service\" is subtech of T1543. So main technique T1543.\n\n- \"Compromise Accounts\"? They use backdoor password to bypass authentication, maybe \"Valid Accounts\" (T1078). But they are creating a backdoor password, not using stolen credentials. Could be \"Valid Accounts\" as they allow attacker-supplied password to succeed.\n\n- \"Credential Access\" maybe \"Credentials In Files\" (T1552) and \"Input Capture\" (T1056). Also \"Exfiltration Over ...\"?

Actually retrieving files from victim system via encrypted commands: that's \"Exfiltration Over Web Service\" maybe T1567? But they read files and send back via HTTP response. That's \"Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel\" T1041? Actually T1041 is Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. Since they use HTTP to send data back, that is exfiltration over web service? T1567 is Exfiltration Over Web Service. But they are using a web shell, which is a command and control channel over HTTP.

Not.\n\n- T1114 Email Collection? Not.\n\n- T1119 Automated Collection: they automatically files. Could be T1119.\n\n- T1567 Exfiltration Over Web Service: they use HTTP web shell, which is a web service. Could be T1567.\n\n- T1041 Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: also.\n\nWe need to map each identified pattern to technique ID from list. Ensure IDs exist in provided list.\n\nList includes: T1071, T1041, T1567, T1132, T1027, T1036, T1005, T1119, T1020, T1565, T1560 etc.\n\nCheck list: T1020 is Automated Exfiltration (present). T1119 Automated Collection (present). T1005 Data from Local System (present). T1567 Exfiltration Over Web Service (present). T1041 Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (present). T1071 Application Layer Protocol (present). T1132 Data Encoding (present). T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information (present). T1036 Masquerading (present). T1565 Data Manipulation (present). T1560 Archive Collected Data (present). T1115 Clipboard Data not needed.\n\nNow reasoning for each.\n\nNow final line: only IDs for main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs. So list IDs: T1071, T1041, T1567, T1132, T1027, T1036, T1005, T1119, T1020, T1565 maybe. Should we include T1560? Not really because they don't archive. So maybe not. Also T1565 Data Manipulation maybe but encryption is manipulation. Could include. Provide reasoning.\n\nNow produce answer with each technique and reasoning, then final line with IDs.\n\nMake sure final line only IDs, no spaces? Probably separated by commas with no extra text. Provide as per instruction.\n\nLet's craft.",

Then final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs.\n\nWe have to look at the text: It's about a web shell that modifies a legitimate file, retrieves files via encrypted commands, listens for HTTP query parameters, uses RC4 key to decrypt, reads files, encrypts and base64 encodes, writes to stdout, exfiltrates. Capabilities: arbitrary file read, exfiltration, web shell, use of RC4 encryption, base64 encoding, command and control via HTTP, etc.\n\nIdentify relevant MITRE techniques:\n\n- T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer? Actually retrieving files from victim system via encrypted commands: that's \"Exfiltration Over Web Service\" maybe T1567? But they read files and send back via HTTP response. That's \"Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel\" T1041? Actually T1041 is Exfiltration Over C2 Channel. Since they use HTTP to send data back, that is exfiltration over web service? T1567 is Exfiltration Over Web Service. But they are using a web shell, which is a command and control channel over HTTP. So T1041 (Exfiltration Over C2 Channel) fits.\n\n- T1071 Application Layer Protocol: they use HTTP for C2. So T1071.\n\n- T1020 Automated Exfiltration? They have ability to automatically read and exfiltrate files. Could be T1020.\n\n- T1560 Archive Collected Data? They encrypt and base64 encode, not archive. Not archive.\n\n- T1132 Data Encoding: base64 encoding. So T1132.\n\n- T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information: RC4 encryption is obfuscation. So T1027.\n\n- T1036 Masquerading: modification to legitimate Pulse Secure file. So T1036.\n\n- T1106 Native API? Not mentioned.\n\n- T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter? Not directly.\n\n- T1048 Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol? Not.\n\n- T1190 Exploit Public-Facing Application? Not.\n\n- T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer? Not.\n\n- T1565 Data Manipulation? They encrypt data before exfiltration, could be considered Data Manipulation (T1565). But maybe not.\n\n- T1070 Indicator Removal? Not.\n\n- T1047 Windows Management Instrumentation? Not.\n\n- T1087 Account Discovery? Not.\n\n- T1083 File and Directory Discovery? Not.\n\n- T1005 Data from Local System: reading files. So T1005.\n\n- T1115 Clipboard Data? Not.\n\n- T1114 Email Collection? Not.\n\n- T1119 Automated Collection: they automatically files. Could be T1119.\n\n- T1567 Exfiltration Over Web Service: they use HTTP web shell, which is a web service. Could be T1567.\n\n- T1041 Exfiltration Over C2 Channel: also.\n\nWe need to map each identified pattern to technique ID from list. Ensure IDs exist in provided list.\n\nList includes: T1071, T1041, T1567, T1132, T1027, T1036, T1005, T1119, T1020, T1565, T1560 etc.\n\nCheck list: T1020 is Automated Exfiltration (present). T1119 Automated Collection (present). T1005 Data from Local System (present). T1567 Exfiltration Over Web Service (present). T1041 Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (present). T1071 Application Layer Protocol (present). T1132 Data Encoding (present). T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information (present). T1036 Masquerading (present). T1565 Data Manipulation (present). T1560 Archive Collected Data (present). T1115 Clipboard Data not needed.\n\nNow reasoning for each.\n\nNow final line: only IDs for main techniques, separated by commas, excluding subtechnique IDs. So list IDs: T1071, T1041, T1567, T1132, T1027, T1036, T1005, T1119, T1020, T1565 maybe. Should we include T1560? Not really because they don't archive. So maybe not. Also T1565 Data Manipulation maybe but encryption is manipulation. Could include. Provide reasoning.\n\nNow produce answer with each technique and reasoning, then final line with IDs.\n\nMake sure final line only IDs, no spaces? Probably separated by commas with no extra text. Provide as per instruction.\n\nLet's craft.",

The text describes a web shell (PULSECHECK) that can:\n\n- check HTTP request headers for a specific backdoor key and output result of command in variable HTTP_X_CMD.\n- use Unix shell script for command execution.\n- base-64 encode encrypted data sent through C2.\n- enable command execution on compromised servers.\n\nWe need to map them to technique IDs from the provided list.\n\nPotential techniques:\n\n- Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059) – using Unix shell script for command execution.\n- Web Shell is a type of Web Service? Could be \"Web Shell\" is a \"Web Service\" technique? There's \"Web Shell\" under T1100? Not in list. But \"Web Service\" is T1102 (Web Service) for C2. However the text mentions using HTTP headers for backdoor key, which is \"Web Shell\" maybe \"Web Service\" or \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) for C2 over HTTP. Also \"Web Shell\" is a \"Web Service\" technique (T1102) but that is for C2 using web services. Could also be \"Exfiltration Over Web Service\" (T1567) but not described.\n\n- \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) for base64 encoding encrypted data. Actually base64 encoding is data encoding (T1132). The list includes T1132: Data Encoding. So base-64 encode encrypted data sent through C2 => Data Encoding (T1132).\n\n- \"Command Execution\" is also \"Remote Execution\"? But the web shell enables command execution on compromised servers, which is \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) or \"Remote Services\" (T1021) maybe. However the technique for using a web shell to execute commands is \"Web Shell\" which is under \"Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell\" (subtechnique T1059.004). Since we only list main technique IDs, we use T1059.\n\n- \"Check HTTP request headers for a specific backdoor key\" could be \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\"? Not exactly. It is a method of receiving commands via HTTP header, which is \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) for C2. Also \"Web Service\" (T1102) is for using web services for C2. The text says \"check HTTP request headers for a specific backdoor key and if found will output the result of the command in the variable HTTP_X_CMD.\" That's basically using HTTP for command and control, which is \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071). So include T1071.\n\n- \"Web shell\" also is \"Web Service\" (T1102) but maybe not needed.\n\n- \"Enable command execution on compromised servers\" could be \"Remote Execution\" but not a specific technique. Could be \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" again.\n\n- \"Base-64 encode encrypted data sent through C2\" also could be \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) but base64 is encoding, not necessarily obfuscation. The list includes both T1027 and T1132. The description says \"base-64 encode encrypted data\". That's encoding, so T1132.\n\n- \"Web shell written in Perl\" could be \"Exploitation for Client Execution\"? Not.\n\n- \"Check HTTP request headers for a specific backdoor key\" could be \"Valid Accounts\"? No.\n\nThus identified techniques: T1059, T1071, T1132.\n\nAlso maybe \"Web Shell\" is \"Web Service\" (T1102) but we can include if we think it's relevant. The text says \"web shell that can enable command execution on compromised servers.\" That's a \"Web Shell\" which is a type of \"Web Service\" used for C2. So we could map to T1102.\n\nBut we need to ensure we only list main technique IDs, not subtechniques. So we can include T1102 as well.\n\nCheck other possible: \"Check HTTP request headers for a specific backdoor key\" could be \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) but that's about exfiltration, not command. So not.\n\nThus final list: T1059, T1071, T1132, T1102.\n\nNow we need to provide reasoning for each identification.\n\nFinally, final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs.

PULSECHECK is a web shell that can enable command execution on compromised servers.",
        "48f16096126dfe57e497d6cb67aef749": "We need to extract MITRE Enterprise attack patterns (techniques) from the given text. The text describes a web shell (PULSECHECK) that can:\n\n- check HTTP request headers for a specific backdoor key and output result of command in variable HTTP_X_CMD.\n- use Unix shell script for command execution.\n- base-64 encode encrypted data sent through C2.\n- enable command execution on compromised servers.\n\nWe need to map them to technique IDs from the provided list.\n\nPotential techniques:\n\n- Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059) – using Unix shell script for command execution.\n- Web Shell is a type of Web Service? Could be \"Web Shell\" is a \"Web Service\" technique? There's \"Web Shell\" under T1100? Not in list. But \"Web Service\" is T1102 (Web Service) for C2. However the text mentions using HTTP headers for backdoor key, which is \"Web Shell\" maybe \"Web Service\" or \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) for C2 over HTTP. Also \"Web Shell\" is a \"Web Service\" technique (T1102) but that is for C2 using web services. Could also be \"Exfiltration Over Web Service\" (T1567) but not described.\n\n- \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) for base64 encoding encrypted data. Actually base64 encoding is data encoding (T1132). The list includes T1132: Data Encoding. So base-64 encode encrypted data sent through C2 => Data Encoding (T1132).\n\n- \"Command Execution\" is also \"Remote Execution\"? But the web shell enables command execution on compromised servers, which is \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) or \"Remote Services\" (T1021) maybe. However the technique for using a web shell to execute commands is \"Web Shell\" which is under \"Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell\" (subtechnique T1059.004). Since we only list main technique IDs, we use T1059.\n\n- \"Check HTTP request headers for a specific backdoor key\" could be \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\"? Not exactly. It is a method of receiving commands via HTTP header, which is \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071) for C2. Also \"Web Service\" (T1102) is for using web services for C2. The text says \"check HTTP request headers for a specific backdoor key and if found will output the result of the command in the variable HTTP_X_CMD.\" That's basically using HTTP for command and control, which is \"Application Layer Protocol\" (T1071). So include T1071.\n\n- \"Web shell\" also is \"Web Service\" (T1102) but maybe not needed.\n\n- \"Enable command execution on compromised servers\" could be \"Remote Execution\" but not a specific technique. Could be \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" again.\n\n- \"Base-64 encode encrypted data sent through C2\" also could be \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) but base64 is encoding, not necessarily obfuscation. The list includes both T1027 and T1132. The description says \"base-64 encode encrypted data\". That's encoding, so T1132.\n\n- \"Web shell written in Perl\" could be \"Exploitation for Client Execution\"? Not.\n\n- \"Check HTTP request headers for a specific backdoor key\" could be \"Valid Accounts\"? No.\n\nThus identified techniques: T1059, T1071, T1132.\n\nAlso maybe \"Web Shell\" is \"Web Service\" (T1102) but we can include if we think it's relevant. The text says \"web shell that can enable command execution on compromised servers.\" That's a \"Web Shell\" which is a type of \"Web Service\" used for C2. So we could map to T1102.\n\nBut we need to ensure we only list main technique IDs, not subtechniques. So we can include T1102 as well.\n\nCheck other possible: \"Check HTTP request headers for a specific backdoor key\" could be \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1041) but that's about exfiltration, not command. So not.\n\nThus final list: T1059, T1071, T1132, T1102.\n\nNow we need to provide reasoning for each identification.\n\nFinally, final line contains only the IDs for the main techniques, separated by commas, excluding any subtechnique IDs. So \"T1059, T1071, T1132, T1102\".\n\nLet's produce answer.",

The list provided includes IDs and names. Need to identify which techniques are described in the text.\n\nText mentions:\n\n- record phone calls -> Audio Capture (T1429) maybe also Call Control (T1616) but recording calls is audio capture. There's also \"Call Control\" maybe for manipulating calls, but recording is audio capture.\n\n- collect and exfiltrate WhatsApp media, photos and files with specific extensions -> Data from Local System (T1533) maybe also Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1646) or Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1639). But primary is Data from Local System (collect) and Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (exfil). However we need main technique IDs, not subtech. Both are main. But we need to list each technique identified.\n\n- includes exploits for jailbreaking infected devices -> Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1404) (jailbreak is privilege escalation). Also maybe Exploitation for Client Execution (T1658) if exploit used to gain code execution. But jailbreaking is privilege escalation.\n\n- download additional malware -> Download New Code at Runtime (T1407) or Ingress Tool Transfer (T1544).

But contact list is data collection. So T1533.\n\n- read SMS messages -> SMS Control (T1582) or \"Read SMS\" is \"SMS Control\". So T1582.\n\n- collect device metadata -> System Information Discovery (T1426) or Device metadata includes location tracking (T1430) but metadata likely system info. So T1426.\n\n- capture pictures and videos -> Screen Capture (T1513) is for screen, but pictures and videos from camera is \"Video Capture\" (T1512) and maybe \"Audio Capture\" for video? There's \"Video Capture\" (T1512). Also \"Screen Capture\" is for screenshot. The text says capture pictures and videos, likely using camera.

The list provided includes IDs and names. Need to identify which techniques are described in the text.\n\nText mentions:\n\n- record phone calls -> Audio Capture (T1429) maybe also Call Control (T1616) but recording calls is audio capture. There's also \"Call Control\" maybe for manipulating calls, but recording is audio capture.\n\n- collect and exfiltrate WhatsApp media, photos and files with specific extensions -> Data from Local System (T1533) maybe also Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1646) or Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1639). But primary is Data from Local System (collect) and Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (exfil). However we need main technique IDs, not subtech. Both are main. But we need to list each technique identified.\n\n- includes exploits for jailbreaking infected devices -> Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1404) (jailbreak is privilege escalation). Also maybe Exploitation for Client Execution (T1658) if exploit used to gain code execution. But jailbreaking is privilege escalation.\n\n- download additional malware -> Download New Code at Runtime (T1407) or Ingress Tool Transfer (T1544). The text says \"download additional malware to the victim device\". That's \"Download New Code at Runtime\" (T1407). Also \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" is about transferring tools. Could be both. Choose T1407.\n\n- used phishing sites for iCloud and Facebook during chat sign up -> Phishing (T1660). Also maybe \"Compromise Application Executable\" but phishing is main.\n\n- masquerade as chat application \"Magic Smile\" -> Masquerading (T1655).\n\n- exfiltrate contact list -> Data from Local System (T1533) again, maybe \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\".

The list provided includes IDs and names. Need to identify which techniques are described in the text.\n\nText mentions:\n\n- record phone calls -> Audio Capture (T1429) maybe also Call Control (T1616) but recording calls is audio capture. There's also \"Call Control\" maybe for manipulating calls, but recording is audio capture.\n\n- collect and exfiltrate WhatsApp media, photos and files with specific extensions -> Data from Local System (T1533) maybe also Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (T1646) or Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol (T1639). But primary is Data from Local System (collect) and Exfiltration Over C2 Channel (exfil). However we need main technique IDs, not subtech. Both are main. But we need to list each technique identified.\n\n- includes exploits for jailbreaking infected devices -> Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1404) (jailbreak is privilege escalation). Also maybe Exploitation for Client Execution (T1658) if exploit used to gain code execution. But jailbreaking is privilege escalation.\n\n- download additional malware -> Download New Code at Runtime (T1407) or Ingress Tool Transfer (T1544). The text says \"download additional malware to the victim device\". That's \"Download New Code at Runtime\" (T1407). Also \"Ingress Tool Transfer\" is about transferring tools. Could be both. Choose T1407.\n\n- used phishing sites for iCloud and Facebook during chat sign up -> Phishing (T1660). Also maybe \"Compromise Application Executable\" but phishing is main.\n\n- masquerade as chat application \"Magic Smile\" -> Masquerading (T1655).\n\n- exfiltrate contact list -> Data from Local System (T1533) again, maybe \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\". But contact list is data collection. So T1533.\n\n- read SMS messages -> SMS Control (T1582) or \"Read SMS\" is \"SMS Control\". So T1582.\n\n- collect device metadata -> System Information Discovery (T1426) or Device metadata includes location tracking (T1430) but metadata likely system info. So T1426.\n\n- capture pictures and videos -> Screen Capture (T1513) is for screen, but pictures and videos from camera is \"Video Capture\" (T1512) and maybe \"Audio Capture\" for video? There's \"Video Capture\" (T1512). Also \"Screen Capture\" is for screenshot. The text says capture pictures and videos, likely using camera. So T1512.\n\n- Also \"Audio Capture\" already for phone calls.\n\n- Possibly \"Call Control\" (T1616) for recording calls? But audio capture is enough.\n\n- \"Exfiltrate\" maybe \"Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\" (T1646) but not explicitly. Could include.\n\nWe need to map each identified pattern to ID.\n\nList of IDs with names:\n\nT1429 : Audio Capture\nT1616 : Call Control\nT1533 : Data from Local System\nT1646 : Exfiltration Over C2 Channel\nT1404 : Exploitation for Privilege Escalation\nT1407 : Download New Code at Runtime\nT1660 : Phishing\nT1655 : Masquerading\nT1582 : SMS Control\nT1426 : System Information Discovery\nT1512 : Video Capture\nT1513 : Screen Capture (maybe not needed)\nT1532 : Archive Collected Data (not mentioned)\nT1647? not in list.\n\nWe need to ensure we only include main technique IDs, not subtechnique IDs. All given IDs are main.\n\nNow produce reasoning for each identification.\n\nFinally final line: list IDs separated by commas, only main technique IDs. Should we include duplicates? No, unique IDs. So list: T1429, T1533, T1404, T1407, T1660, T1655, T1582, T1426, T1512, T1646? If we include exfiltration. The text mentions exfiltrate WhatsApp media, contact list. That's exfiltration. So include T1646.\n\nAlso maybe T1616 (Call Control) but not needed. We'll include T1616? The text says \"record phone calls\". That's audio capture, not call control. So skip.\n\nThus final IDs: T1429, T1533, T1404, T1407, T1660, T1655, T1582, T1426, T1512, T1646\n\nProvide reasoning for each.\n\nLet's craft answer.",

GLASSTOKEN is a web shell capable of tunneling C2 connections and code execution on compromised Ivanti Secure Connect VPNs.\"\n\nWe need to identify attack patterns (techniques) described.\n\nKey points:\n\n- Custom web shell used to execute commands on compromised VPNs. That's \"Web Shell\" is a type of \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) maybe \"Command Execution\". Also \"Web Shell\" is a \"Web Service\" (T1102) or \"Web Shell\" is a \"Web Shell\" technique? In MITRE, \"Web Shell\" is T1100? Actually MITRE Enterprise has \"Web Shell\" as a subtechnique of \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\"? Wait: In ATT&CK, \"Web Shell\" is T1100? Let's recall: T1100 is \"Web Shell\"? Actually T1100 is \"Web Shell\" in older version. In ATT&CK v12, \"Web Shell\" is T1059.007? No, T1059 is Command and Scripting Interpreter, subtechnique .001 PowerShell, .003 Windows Command Shell, .005 Visual Basic, .006 Python, .007 JavaScript, .008 Network Device CLI, .009 Unix Shell. \"Web Shell\" is T1100? I think \"Web Shell\" is T1100 (Legacy). But the list provided includes T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) and T1102 (Web Service). There's also T1071 (Application Layer Protocol). There's T1572 (Protocol Tunneling). There's T1090 (Proxy). There's T1571 (Non-Standard Port). There's T1071 (Application Layer Protocol). There's T1572 (Protocol Tunneling). There's T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer). There's T1132 (Data Encoding). There's T1140 (Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information). There's T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information). There's T1086? Not in list. There's T1086 is PowerShell but not listed; but T1059 includes PowerShell subtechnique but not separate ID. However we have T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter). So we can map PowerShell usage to T1059.\n\n- Hexadecimal and Base64 encoded C2 content, ability to decode. That's \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) or \"Data Encoding\" (T1132) or \"Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\" (T1140). The text says \"has hexadecimal and Base64 encoded C2 content\" and \"ability to decode\". That is about encoding/decoding. So technique: Data Encoding (T1132) and Deobfuscate/Decode (T1140). Also could be \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027). Choose best: Since they encode C2 content, that's Data Encoding (T1132). Decoding is Deobfuscate/Decode (T1140). Could also be \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" but we can include both.\n\n- Web shell capable of tunneling C2 connections. That's \"Protocol Tunneling\" (T1572). Also \"Web Shell\" is a type of \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\"? But we can map to \"Protocol Tunneling\" (T1572). Also \"Web Shell\" may be \"Web Service\" (T1102) for C2. But the list includes T1102: Web Service. Could be \"Web Shell\" uses HTTP to communicate, but not explicit. However \"tunneling C2 connections\" is definitely T1572.\n\n- \"execute commands on compromised VPNs\" is \"Command Execution\" (T1059). Also \"Remote Services\" (T1021) maybe because they are using VPN remote service? But they are already on the VPN, using web shell to execute commands. Could be \"Remote Services\" but not explicit. The main technique is \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\".\n\n- \"custom web shell\" could be \"Web Shell\" (T1100) but not in list. So we may map to \"Web Service\" (T1102) as a C2 channel.\n\n- \"PowerShell for command execution\" is T1059 (PowerShell subtechnique). So we map to T1059.\n\nThus identified techniques: T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter), T1132 (Data Encoding), T1140 (Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information), T1572 (Protocol Tunneling), possibly T1102 (Web Service) but not sure. Also maybe T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information) but we can include if needed. The instruction: \"Extract all MITRE Enterprise attack patterns from the following text and map them to their corresponding MITRE technique IDs.\" So we should list each technique we think is present.\n\nLet's list:\n\n- Use of PowerShell for command execution => T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) (specifically PowerShell subtechnique but main ID is T1059).\n\n- Hexadecimal and Base64 encoded C2 content => T1132 (Data Encoding) (encoding of data).\n\n- Ability to decode hexadecimal and Base64 C2 requests => T1140 (Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information) (decoding).\n\n- Web shell capable of tunneling C2 connections => T1572 (Protocol Tunneling).\n\n- Web shell used for command execution on compromised system => also T1102 (Web Service) maybe but not explicit. Could be \"Web Shell\" is a type of \"Web Service\" used for C2. The list includes T1102: Web Service. So we can map.\n\n- Use of custom web shell => maybe T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) but not needed.\n\nThus final IDs: T1059, T1132, T1140, T1572, T1102.\n\nBut we must ensure we exclude subtechnique IDs. All are main IDs.\n\nNow produce answer with reasoning for each identification, then final line with IDs separated by commas.\n\nLet's craft.",

GLASSTOKEN is a web shell capable of tunneling C2 connections and code execution on compromised Ivanti Secure Connect VPNs.\"\n\nWe need to identify attack patterns (techniques) described.\n\nKey points:\n\n- Custom web shell used to execute commands on compromised VPNs. That's \"Web Shell\" is a type of \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\" (T1059) maybe \"Command Execution\". Also \"Web Shell\" is a \"Web Service\" (T1102) or \"Web Shell\" is a \"Web Shell\" technique? In MITRE, \"Web Shell\" is T1100? Actually MITRE Enterprise has \"Web Shell\" as a subtechnique of \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\"? Wait: In ATT&CK, \"Web Shell\" is T1100? Let's recall: T1100 is \"Web Shell\"? Actually T1100 is \"Web Shell\" in older version. In ATT&CK v12, \"Web Shell\" is T1059.007? No, T1059 is Command and Scripting Interpreter, subtechnique .001 PowerShell, .003 Windows Command Shell, .005 Visual Basic, .006 Python, .007 JavaScript, .008 Network Device CLI, .009 Unix Shell. \"Web Shell\" is T1100? I think \"Web Shell\" is T1100 (Legacy). But the list provided includes T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) and T1102 (Web Service). There's also T1071 (Application Layer Protocol). There's T1572 (Protocol Tunneling). There's T1090 (Proxy). There's T1571 (Non-Standard Port). There's T1071 (Application Layer Protocol). There's T1572 (Protocol Tunneling). There's T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer). There's T1132 (Data Encoding). There's T1140 (Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information). There's T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information). There's T1086? Not in list. There's T1086 is PowerShell but not listed; but T1059 includes PowerShell subtechnique but not separate ID. However we have T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter). So we can map PowerShell usage to T1059.\n\n- Hexadecimal and Base64 encoded C2 content, ability to decode. That's \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027) or \"Data Encoding\" (T1132) or \"Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information\" (T1140). The text says \"has hexadecimal and Base64 encoded C2 content\" and \"ability to decode\". That is about encoding/decoding. So technique: Data Encoding (T1132) and Deobfuscate/Decode (T1140). Also could be \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" (T1027). Choose best: Since they encode C2 content, that's Data Encoding (T1132). Decoding is Deobfuscate/Decode (T1140). Could also be \"Obfuscated Files or Information\" but we can include both.\n\n- Web shell capable of tunneling C2 connections. That's \"Protocol Tunneling\" (T1572). Also \"Web Shell\" is a type of \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\"? But we can map to \"Protocol Tunneling\" (T1572). Also \"Web Shell\" may be \"Web Service\" (T1102) for C2. But the list includes T1102: Web Service. Could be \"Web Shell\" uses HTTP to communicate, but not explicit. However \"tunneling C2 connections\" is definitely T1572.\n\n- \"execute commands on compromised VPNs\" is \"Command Execution\" (T1059). Also \"Remote Services\" (T1021) maybe because they are using VPN remote service? But they are already on the VPN, using web shell to execute commands. Could be \"Remote Services\" but not explicit. The main technique is \"Command and Scripting Interpreter\".\n\n- \"custom web shell\" could be \"Web Shell\" (T1100) but not in list. So we may map to \"Web Service\" (T1102) as a C2 channel.\n\n- \"PowerShell for command execution\" is T1059 (PowerShell subtechnique). So we map to T1059.\n\nThus identified techniques: T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter), T1132 (Data Encoding), T1140 (Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information), T1572 (Protocol Tunneling), possibly T1102 (Web Service) but not sure. Also maybe T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information) but we can include if needed. The instruction: \"Extract all MITRE Enterprise attack patterns from the following text and map them to their corresponding MITRE technique IDs.\" So we should list each technique we think is present.\n\nLet's list:\n\n- Use of PowerShell for command execution => T1059 (Command and Scripting Interpreter) (specifically PowerShell subtechnique but main ID is T1059).\n\n- Hexadecimal and Base64 encoded C2 content => T1132 (Data Encoding) (encoding of data).\n\n- Ability to decode hexadecimal and Base64 C2 requests => T1140 (Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information) (decoding).\n\n- Web shell capable of tunneling C2 connections => T1572 (Protocol Tunneling).\n\n- Web shell used for command execution on compromised system => also T1102 (Web Service) maybe but not explicit. Could be \"Web Shell\" is a type of \"Web Service\" used for C2. The list includes T1102: Web Service. So we can map.\n\n- Use of custom web shell => maybe T1071 (Application Layer Protocol) but not needed.\n\nThus final IDs: T1059, T1132, T1140, T1572, T1102.\n\nBut we must ensure we exclude subtechnique IDs. All are main IDs.\n\nNow produce answer with reasoning for each identification, then final line with IDs separated by commas.\n\nLet's craft.",

Both PowerShell and the Windows command shell are covered by the Command‑and‑Scripting Interpreter technique. |\n| **T1083 – File and Directory Discovery** | Akira “examines files prior to encryption … through native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW”. Querying file attributes to decide which files to encrypt is a classic File/Directory Discovery behavior. |\n| **T1082 – System Information Discovery** | The malware “uses the GetSystemInfo Windows function to determine the number of processors on a victim machine”. Gathering CPU count is a form of System Information Discovery. |\n| **T1135 – Network Share Discovery** | Akira “can identify remote file shares for encryption”. Locating shared network resources is exactly Network Share Discovery. |\n| **T1057 – Process Discovery** | The ransomware “verifies the deletion of volume shadow copies by checking for the existence of the process ID related to the process created to delete these items”. Looking for a specific process ID is a Process Discovery activity. |\n| **T1047 – Windows Management Instrumentation** | It “leverages COM objects accessed through WMI during execution to evade detection”. Use of WMI for execution or discovery maps to the Windows Management Instrumentation technique. |\n| **T1106 – Native API** | The malware “executes native Windows functions such as GetFileAttributesW and GetSystemInfo”. Direct calls to native Windows APIs are captured by the Native API technique. |\n| **T1490 – Inhibit System Recovery** | Akira “deletes system volume shadow copies via PowerShell commands”. Removing shadow copies is a common method to prevent system recovery, which is the Inhibit System Recovery technique. |\n| **T1486 – Data Encrypted for Impact** | The primary payload “encrypts victim filesystems for financial extortion purposes”. Encrypting data to cause impact is the Data Encrypted for Impact technique. |\n\n**Final list of main technique IDs (comma‑separated, no sub‑technique IDs)**  \nT1059, T1083, T1082, T1135, T1057, T1047, T1106, T1490, T1486"
