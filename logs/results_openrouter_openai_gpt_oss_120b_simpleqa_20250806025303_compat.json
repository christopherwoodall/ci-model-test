He\u2019s a \u201cfix\u2011it\u201d type of character\u2014smart, discreet, and willing to dig up dirt for the right client. The show uses him as a narrative tool to uncover secrets that have been hidden for years.\n\n---\n\n## Why He Came to Genoa City\n\n### 1. **Hired by Victor Newman**\nThe primary reason David Chow shows up in Genoa City is that **Victor Newman** (the patriarch of the Newman empire) hires him. Victor has a long history of employing investigators, detectives, and \u201cpeople who can get things done\u201d when he feels his empire or his family is under threat.\n\n- **Goal:** Victor wants Chow to **dig up any compromising information** on his son **Adam Newman** and on the **Abbott family**\u2014especially anything that could be used as leverage in the power struggle over Newman Enterprises and the Abbott\u2019s cosmetics empire.\n\n### 2. **Investigating the \u201cAbbott Secret\u201d**\nAround the same time Victor is suspicious that **Ashley Abbott** is hiding something about a **pregnancy/baby** (the \u201cAbbott secret\u201d storyline). Victor fears that a child with a Newman bloodline could shift the balance of power in the city\u2019s business world.\n\n- **Chow\u2019s Assignment:**  \n  - Locate the mother of the baby (if the baby isn\u2019t Ashley\u2019s).  \n  - Find out who knows about the pregnancy and whether any evidence exists that could be used to blackmail or protect the parties involved.\n\n### 3. **Looking Into a Missing Person / Stolen Asset**\nA secondary, but still important, thread that brings Chow to town is the **disappearance of a key witness** (later revealed to be a former associate of Victor\u2019s who knows about a hidden **Newman family ledger**). The ledger supposedly details past illegal deals and could be a bombshell if it ever got into the hands of Victor\u2019s rivals.\n\n- **Chow\u2019s Task:** Track down the missing witness, recover the ledger, and determine who else might be after it.\n\n### 4. **Personal Motive \u2013 A Favor for an Old Friend**\nLater in the arc, it\u2019s hinted that Chow has a **personal stake**. He owes a favor to **Neil Winters**, who once helped him out of a bad spot early in his career.
